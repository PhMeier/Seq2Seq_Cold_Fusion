mr president, i wholeheartedly support this report which focuses its attention on the importance of local employment markets.
i think that mr rothley attacked me personally.

sv madam president, the commission has studied with great interest the interim report by mrs aelvoet on article 36@@ 6@@ a of the lomé convention along with the opinion of the rex committee and the committee for external affairs.

as far as the pc@@ b poly@@ chlor@@ inated bi@@ phen@@ ol directive is concerned, we should also turn our attention to the supplies.

it is vitally important to preserve the political legitimacy of the commission in all member states and in the eyes of each national electorate.

in recent centuries, south caucasus has constantly been ri@@ ven by conflict. surely, in 2002, it must be possible to stabilise these regions at last and give the people there a future and the chance to live their lives in peace and with some measure of lasting prosperity in their home territories.
i think this is one of the crucial democracy issues that the country faces today.
in view of the fact that this is a recasting of the regulations, amendments nos 3 to 9 and 15 are being rejected.
the european union's task is to support and complement the activities carried out in the member states, not to take responsibility for them.
the fact is that the market, on its own, cannot guarantee either the quality or the completion of all of the tasks relating to these services, regardless of whether they are connected to society, territorial planning or strategic and national interests.
this is the best possible form of assistance that could be provided.
hence the need to support research into the production of solar panels designed and produced in europe and to promote the adoption of economies of scale in the photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic@@ -@@ solar sector, by introducing such devices, for example, extensively in european cities.

these countries are tra@@ ver@@ sed by increasing migratory flows which they describe as characteristic of our time, by citizens travelling from africa to europe, which they see as heaven on earth.
in the commission's initiative, i do not see the general population being involved as players.
at the moment there are agricultural sectors in the mediterranean and also in the outermost regions of the community, which could be threatened as a result of the very generous proposed concessions by the commission.

however, i hope that ireland@@ ’s historic relations with the united states will serve to promote, if not a full, free trade eu-@@ usa agreement – now that the wto, post-@@ canc@@ un, is fat@@ ally wounded – at least a common economic space for trade in goods and services, particularly financial services.
the report is therefore on the right track.
has it already evaluated the participation of smes in existing community support programmes for sm@@ es?
the financing of projects in this area will help to stimulate economic recovery in europe, and indeed in my own country, ireland, and help to create new employment opportunities and also help in the fight against climate change.

. – the communist party of greece voted against the report, because it uses social problems of the working classes to speed up and extend capitalist restructur@@ ings which affect both sexes.
since the europe agreements are still in force, governments are naturally free to go on concluding bilateral accor@@ ds.

moreover, it is because of these efforts that the national governments need to concur with our line of thinking.
it is important that croatia implements properly its legislation on minority rights.
the great acts of social mobilisation that have taken place throughout the world, specifically at the european social forum, against the wto and its various proposals, specifically the agreement on services, which jeopardises high-quality public services, prove the need for us to review the commission’s mandate.
i would agree with him that ideally subsidies should support structural change.

for the moment, however, the american securities and exchange commission is silent on the subject, despite calls for changes from congress.
europe’s increased size following the latest enlargement clearly justifies the idea of design@@ ating two european capitals of culture per year.
vice-president of the commission. - madam president, let me begin by saying that, as everyone knows, the common european visa policy has so far brought us tangible results with several third countries, such as, very recently, canada and australia.

correctly used, and in certain very special cases, often security issues, increased cooperation can be in the interest of european integration.
this is achieved by setting safety thresholds or maximum residue levels mr@@ ls for approved substances and by banning substances which are either found to be unsafe or in respect of which a safety profile cannot be scientifically established.
after all, the number of errors in relation to the structural funds has been too high for many years now.
i personally therefore have every sympathy for the idea.
there is no apparent will to do this, and that must be deplo@@ red.
this was not, may i say, without resistance from certain political groups in this house.
it is an industry that generates 9 million jobs and could generate far more.
let us play our part in preparing the provincial elec@@ tions; europe and its member states must play an effective supportive role, not only in the electoral process from beginning to end, but also in the subsequent period of reconstruction.

it is several years now since parliament proposed amendments to electoral legislation, and why indeed should the people of europe not have the long-@@ overdue opportunity to choose between various european lists of candidates put forward by european parties at the next elec@@ tions?

for some people, including myself, they stop at the north african countries, which are our neighbours and friend@@ s; it is therefore appropriate to envisage optimum partnerships with them.
the fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of europe' s citizens.
the third danger relates to the economy.
if we now adopt new european feed legislation here in parliament, by what will probably be a large majority, and the council accepts this legislation, we shall have achieved a new, high quality standard in europe.
to conclude, i would ask the council urgently to come to agreement on this issue.
we further propose to retain unanimity for decisions on tax rates and the points of taxation.
mr president, for me it is an honour that my first speech during question time in parliament is an answer to questions concerning women.
in all these sectors, we call on advanced communications technologies.
the development of these new indicators will help to understand and measure the quality of life in societies.
it is quite right that small european banks are not in direct competition with us institutions excluded from the basel obligations, but instead with these institutions' corporate customers.

secondly, pric@@ e: this in turn should mean that the price of airline ticke@@ ts, kept artificially high by the present system, could go down by as much as 10% as a result, according to the commission's research.

the union was to have become the world's most competitive region by 2010 and an engine for growth, as our member states' leaders put it so beauti@@ fully at lisbon.

indeed, measures to prevent children being exposed to such material via the new electronic media are part and parcel of programmes in britain aimed at increasing access to the internet in schools.
however, israel does respect money, and the only way to put pressure upon israel is therefore to demand preliminary talks on our trade agreements.

ancient greece besto@@ wed on human@@ kind among other things the joy of the olympic games.
mrs fra@@ ga@@ 's report is the result of the recommendations on the control scheme adopted by the north-east atlantic fisheries commission ne@@ af@@ c in 2006, although the convention was drawn up in 198@@ 2, and it re@@ defines the rules for control and enforcement for vessels in the convention areas.

indeed, the christian go@@ spe@@ ls say it is worthy of a mill@@ stone around the ne@@ ck.
the trialogu@@ es on the issue of the legal bases were a complete failure, mr president, and i would like to hope that the positions of the european parliament were beginning to be accepted as logical and admissi@@ ble.

these are very wise words.
this makes sense.

helping developing countries together with local farmers to ensure they have food sovereignty is quite simply essential, all the more so because, today, food sovereignty, like the democratic legitimacy of these countries' governments, is threatened by a new and particularly worrying phenomenon, the acquisition of arable land by foreign investors following the rise in food prices in 2007.
the european union chose to divide this task between the commission and the member states.
mr president, on a point of order, i appreciate your comments but this is one of the fundamental problems we have with the commission at present.
however, we must put under the mic@@ ros@@ cope activities that were undertaken in the past on the basis of a surplus in this budget.
what is clear, is that the new president of the commission must assume not just the political responsibility for the commission, but the political leadership as well.
on 11 september i was on my way to a mission to afghanistan and to pakistan.
i was somewhat surprised to read paragraph 3 in particular. from it we learn that in order to guarantee the success of this agenda, we also need to strengthen economic growth in europe.
on the other hand, it is very important for europe to have access to african mineral resources, and this is a policy that it is pursuing together with china and the russian federation.
that is not the problem.
it may be that your interpretation of the treaty on the functioning of the eu is different from mine.
issues regarding the family reunification of people benefiting from temporary protection and subsidiary protection must be examined in an autonomous legal instrument that the commission, by the way, is currently prepar@@ ing, and which it will present to parliament and the council next year.

it appears that the brutality of the regime in minsk knows no boun@@ ds, and the way in which they are now managing to close down the osce office in that city by no longer issuing visas to diplomats who work there, is in itself a disgrace which once again illustrates how poor the quality of democracy in that country is.
we have many directorate-@@ generals involved, three different funds, six different objectives and a number of programmes that go from community initiatives to article 7 and article 10 through to the main structural funding itself.

this is patently fal@@ se, because no-one has ever asked that the member states pool 100% of their debts.
now to my final point which i will keep short@@ : we hear a great deal about what is needed to facilitate the work of the investigation authorities.
that would make the peace process impossible for the foreseeable future.
we have sound growth.
the old meda programme, which is being up@@ dated, included a special structural adjustment programme for jord@@ an.
despite the continuing efforts of the eu and the rest of the international community, the terrible reality in afghanistan unfortunately shows that the taliban regime has remained imper@@ vious to argument and pressure from abroad.
this is the message conveyed by our latest summit, which also produced the specific internal results i am just about to discuss, and we want to continue to send out this signal in two weeks' time - as we have just been discussing - at the celebrations in berlin and throughout europe for the 50th anniversary of the union.
that is why liberals in this house insist that the inspectors be allowed to continue their work.
instead of having to use 15 separate prospect@@ uses to reach retail investors in the existing european union, in future an issu@@ er of bonds or shares will only need one.
it is very important that the commission should not go beyond this.

there is a europe of the institutions, i.e. the commission, the council of ministers and parliament, on the one hand@@ ; on the other hand, there is the europe of the people.
the ancho@@ vy fishery in the bay of bis@@ c@@ ay is of great socio-economic importance, and its closure in 2005 has caused great damage to groups that depend on it fishermen, net mend@@ ers, the can@@ ning industry, etc@@ ..
i believe that the lisbon treaty gave the european parliament additional responsibilities.
the people in arab countries would also have hoped for a greater share in economic development than has been the case.
i voted in favour of the compromises worked out between parliament and the council of the eu.
in writing. - i voted for this report, which proposes a range of improvements to the transparency of the cap.
i am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, i would not be here today.
we also need to look at article 92 and the following articles today and ask to what extent tax competition in the european union, which is unfair and ruin@@ ous, is not in practice a form of state aid, and as such incompatible with the principle of the internal market and non-discrimination between member states.
the right to asylum is, first and foremost, a fundamental value in any society that seeks to protect democracy, dignity and human rights.

mr president, thank you for giving me the floor in what seems, at this stage in the evening, more like an open meeting of the constitutional affairs committee, with some other members very welcome to join us.
and the third, and perhaps most important, is what direction must we give to the peace process in 2001@@ ?
the simplest overall solution, both for us in this house and for the council, would certainly have been to accept the commission's proposal.
the '@@ comfort women' system is one of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20th century and led to gang ra@@ pes on a massive scale and to forced abor@@ tions.
the report also emphasises the principle of subsidiarity.
so far, i have no real information available about progress here.
the liberalisation of foreign investment and other forms of capital mobility must place emphasis on sustainable development and cannot be a loophole for the disrespect or destruction of the fundamental social interests and rights of workers.
at the same time, i am following with great attention the repeated efforts of the commission and certain other parties, for whom the proposed target seems, on the contrary, rather un@@ ambitious, to reopen the debate on this topic and to try and change this regulation in order to set more stringent targets.
i believe that that is not at all necessary.
the market principle alone is not compatible with the pursuit of national strategic objectives or the safeguarding of a country’s vital interests.
i also welcome the importance given by the eib to small and medium-sized enterprises smes, to sustainable energy and the mitigation of climate change, and to the investments in the convergence regions of the eu particularly hard hit by the recent economic slow@@ down.

like it or not, it is not the path of gl@@ ory it aspi@@ red to be for the citizens of the member states.
mr president, honourable members, since 1999 the european union has been applying sanctions against the taliban regime in afghanistan.
and why, president-in-office, commissioner, are we simply ignoring mr de so@@ to's criticisms of the quarte@@ t's policy?
it is difficult to have peace without democracy.
we therefore believe that the military action and the simplistic propaganda must come to an end as quickly as possible. all our energy must be devoted to returning to the search for a political solution.
in the bananas case the american administration promised congress to implement sanctions at the latest by 3 march 1999 whatever happens in the wto@@ !
what action?
toxic waste is an extremely important issue.
pla@@ ice fishing is important for my country, the netherlands, but also for france, belgium, england and denmark.

under the austrian presidency we began the first joint council with mexico yesterday.
the integrated planning approach adopted in recent years is relatively widely used in drawing up urban plans for larger cities in europe.
the wage gap is still unacceptably wide.
these countries are even less well placed than regions within the eu to solve the transitional problems that arise if part of the production is stopped.
we have a multitude of international conventions and we have had pronouncements from the eu in many contexts.
we will be producing a communication on anti-personnel land@@ mines, actually the use of sen@@ sor equipment.

mr president, i would like to thank karl von wogau for his balanced report, which very extensively deals with the issues of the single market in an analytical manner.
it therefore has the right to defend itself@@ ; it has the right to respond.
since that time, the spring councils have provided the opportunity to discuss economic, social and environmental issues as part of a wide-ranging strategy for sustainable development.
pl mr president, history tends to repeat itself.
this is a particularly topical idea, especially in those regions where the older generation already represents the majority, which is the case in most of europe.
that is the final element of good legislation.
i would like to use this speech to defend the fundamental role of women’s organisations in the promotion of the european union’s equal opportunities policy.
we maintain that the west also has a responsibility for letting violence take hold.
they cannot be surrendered to these private groups, who are concerned with their own profits and not with the interests of users.
while the spread of this vi@@ rul@@ ent disease has raised legitimate questions about how the uk authorities are handling it, i would like to dissociate myself and my colleagues from the inte@@ m@@ per@@ ate and highly inappropriate comments made by certain junior ministers in the irish government.
i do not want to discuss that at length now, maybe next time i shall say more.
finally, mr president, i think that it is of the utmost importance that the commission, which has been working very well on this aspect, should have a sufficient margin of flexibility and should not be limited by a budgetary strait@@ jacket that prevents it from carrying out this excellent mission.
in laos, a country under military dictatorship, the leaders of the students and teachers movement set up a decade ago are still being held in secret detention.
côte d'ivoire is the world's largest producer of cocoa and one of the most important producers of coffe@@ e.

even sex@@ -@@ selection techniques are prohibited in almost all member states.
the much-@@ discussed pillars, which cannot yet be said to carry the entire institutional lo@@ ad, are what will make the union a political - not just an economic - force to be reckoned with worldwide.
maybe the commission should look at the levels of grant aid.
that is what i take from this debate, anyway, and i have always been convinced of it.
a com which strengthens the entire fisheries sector is therefore essential, because of these major constraints, which already significantly limit community preference.
one of the priorities on the agenda for debate singled out by mrs merkel is the strengthening of what is referred to as the 'new transatlantic economic partnership@@ ' with the aim of setting up a '@@ barri@@ er-@@ free transatlantic market' in the years ahead.
mr president, i should like to say that today's debate is a strange and frankly paradoxical one.
this continent - the european union - needs to be more inv@@ enti@@ ve.
i do not know if the daphne programme suffic@@ es or if something more is required.
we must realize that the consequences of climate change on the water regime may cause a domin@@ o effect and may impact on many sectors of the economy.

some of the questions that have been raised, especially on the role of the european parliament in the field of justice and home affairs and on protecting the citizen@@ ' s fundamental rights in the european judicial area, will figure very largely on the agenda of that debate.
since then, the country has made strenuous efforts to comply with eu recommendations, especially as regards the transposition of european legislation.
i have raised this matter myself in very clear terms.
in the us the average approval time is half that: 15 months.
the debate is closed.
we need a debate to get the regulation of competences revised in the light of the internal market strategy and of the lisbon strategy and made the basis of the work in the convention.
such an initiative would bring peoples closer.
i am essentially talking about the services responsible for development cooperation, agriculture, regional development, the environment and technological research and development.

by adopting the '@@ small business ac@@ t' in 2008, the european commission made the first decisive step for these smes by introducing the '@@ think small first@@ ' principle in all areas of legislation.
this is because, not satisfied with supranational integration, which weakens the member states by ri@@ dding them of their sovereignty from the top, or with inf@@ ran@@ ational region@@ alisation, which works from the bottom up, it is language, one of the essential components of national unity of some member states, that is being attac@@ ked.
there is a lot in them and a lot of it is right.
on the basis of that joint action, we are awaiting a robust initiative from the european union to secure the banning of mines.
i would also have been able to understand it if it had been put in your own language.
with regard to the elections, you surely remember how hopeful i was in july that we could also dis@@ patch an electoral observation mission.
of course, the unemployment rate is too high, but i am very pleased that, compared with six months ago, our growth predictions are much better than anticipated and that growth is more stable than we thought.

for it to do so, the main eligibility criterion would need to be the contribution made by projects to local and regional development and to the combatting of the structural problems of the economy, rather than to the achievement of the objectives and policies of the european union.

i believe in clarity, precision and consistency.
madam president, both the green paper from the commission and the report by mr bar@@ z@@ ant@@ i adopt a stance of critical openness towards the challenge of new information technology.
machinery includes tractors and any kind of small but very often extremely noisy machines that are used, for example, in parks to blow leav@@ es.
the position of the council with regard to funding is disappointing.
since various european countries are the '@@ destin@@ ation' for such networks, i welcome this initiative to create a common framework for preventing and combating human trafficking at european level, an approach which stems from parliament's proposal for a resolution, on which we voted on 10 february 2010.
the transitional period of five years proposed by the ppe-de group for the entry into force of the directive is adequate and, in my opinion, more than gener@@ ous.
fires are frequent in these areas and it would therefore be a good idea, or rather appropriate to use these people to help prevent fires.
i also believe that the main obstacle to this directive@@ ’s adoption in 1989 and 1996 – the effect of takeover bids on employment and their social repercussions in general – must remain at the heart of regulatory concerns.
the danger from other threats is clearly growing, and so energy and food security are becoming important.
in committee, we jointly drew up and put forward criteria which have to be met by products designated ‘@@ fair trade@@ ’ so as not to deceive consumers.

this has surely always been possible.
at last we have a proposal that will guarantee equal opportunities for all member states and improve the working of the internal market as regards reduced vat rates.
as you know, before you can make a legislative proposal you need a public consultation, which takes time.
the different proposals will undoubtedly be debated in parliament and they will clearly be amended on many occasions but, nonetheless, they are real proposals which can be discussed.
this is also a task for the council; we cannot do this on our own.
i would like to ask you to see to it that the conditions are improved.
if we are to stem the tide of the effects that humans are having on the environment, we surely have to start by making radical changes in the way we use and produce energy.

this aims to ensure that, throughout the process of restructuring companies, particularly industrial companies, employees' representatives have access to information and the possibility of intervening in the decision-making process, including the right of veto, in cases where companies do not comply with their contractual obligations.
i hope that this white paper will serve as an important basis for a far-reaching debate on how we could realize the vision of the eu as an area of freedom, security and justice.

it is also so that israel as a state imposes hard economic sanctions against the palestinians by, for example, obstructing their export of flowers to the union.

we will continue to review the extent to which the instruments of human rights clauses, sanctions and dialogue - all of which have been scrutinised extensively by this parliament - can play an effective role as part of our overall external policy, whilst ensuring the highest standards of respect for human rights.
we are very pleased to see you here.
we need the constitutional treaty in order to develop a genuine common policy on asylum and immigration, and the external dimension will certainly have to be given pride of place.

this year, 2006, reminds me of 2001, when we were with the sar@@ c delegation in j@@ aff@@ na and saw the results of the civil war, in the shape of ruined villages, scor@@ ched earth, and tens of thousands of be@@ wil@@ dered and desperate refugees.
the commission can therefore be considered the executive branch of the union.
we need to outline a europe-wide scheme for peace and cooperation for the twenty-first century.
not every kind of data is inclu@@ ded; not everything is capable of being sto@@ red, but only a very limited category, on the internet@@ : storage of movement data applies only to the on@@ set of movement, unsuccessful calls are to be recorded only where this is already in place at national level.
the commission must see to it that the additional funding is used properly, flexibly and in a way that strengthens the basic structures of society.
the objective therefore is to establish a link between the two.
as far as the two christian states - georgia and armenia - are concerned, i should firstly like to say that it is certainly right that we should develop relations with and assist georgia, but this should not mean that we put our trust in russia's gau@@ le@@ iter in georgia, mr sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ n@@ adz@@ e.
mr president, avian flu is once again knocking on europe’s door.

for us as well this is about an overall proactive and socially responsible approach to the management of industrial change.

solidarity with chile is a very beautiful thing, and it is good that the european union is showing that solidarity.
of course, it was the united kingdom that had the first woman prime minister in europe.

and taxes do provide a strong incentive for consumers.
farmers in the plain are in second place.
it would, then, be great if governments could demonstrate something like the same degree of environmental awareness as do their citizens.

we have to realize that this is a difficult form of trafficking, that sales are not as easy as in the case of drugs, for example.
in today's vote, we saw support for the report concerning innovative financing in the world and in europe.

i support the commission's view that the minimum period for maternity leave should be raised across the union from the present 14 weeks to 18 weeks, with compensation paid at the rate in place for a period of illness, at the very least.
but we can put that to one side for now.
in the most recent directives we formulated for the customs union, we also legislated for modern technology, introducing the electronic customs system.
we did not want to burden the accession of these two countries with the issue of the future procedure, but i hope that we can come to an agreement with the commission and the council today to ensure that, in future, there is a better procedure and a more serious opportunity for parliament to give its opinion on this issue.

it is fundamental that everyone should be guaranteed access to information so as to benefit from all the educational and cultural opportunities in the public and private sector which arise from the new technologies.

with the granting of the european parliament's assent to the conclusion of the fisheries agreement between the kingdom of morocco and the european union today, a new framework for cooperation has been established. this will be balanced cooperation between the two parties in a sensitive area: the conservation of fisheries resources and their economic exploitation, directly or after processing.

our aim is not to issue an opinion on the validity or otherwise of this decision to repeal directive 6@@ 8/@@ 89/@@ eec, although, as a rule, we have our reservations as regards the commission's harmonising tenden@@ cies. our view is indeed shared by most businesses and member states in stating that they do not apply this directive.

as the rapporteur for this parliament on the original resolution four years ago, i cannot but comment that this represents a failure of political commitment in europe to aiding five million refugees, some of the poorest of the poor, in asia and in latin america.
i therefore feel that, until i am protected - i am speaking on my own behalf but there are also many other people, older people like myself or people who have less expertise than many young people - i will do without electronic commerce, because it is not something in which i have confidence.
if they say they do not know, take them and send them home to roman@@ ia@@ '.

in writing. - i support dan@@ ut@@ bud@@ re@@ ik@@ a@@ it@@ ė@@ 's report on the challenge of eu development cooperation policy for new member states.
this is scandalous.
the environment too has its limits and this is an important, in fact, vital question which we may need to ask ourselves, not so much following on from my report but following on from mrs lucas@@ ' report.
there was a meeting on that important subject in the so-called '@@ high level reflection group' last week.
now is the time for us jointly to implement the recommendations of the '@@ small business ac@@ t'.
thank you very much, commissioner patten.
the convention's extension of codecision to budgetary powers would have made the european union more accountable and transparent.

the fact that we are discussing the 1995 commission report on monitoring the cfp in march 1998 is indicative of the slowness with which action is seen to be taken on enforcement.
mr president, the issue of the reform of rule 6 was raised first by the controversy surrounding the application by the spanish courts to waive the immunity of two italian members of the european parliament.
the statistics are not merely numbers, they are family tragedi@@ es, they are children who are left orph@@ ans, they are people who die who could have been saved.

import of poultry car@@ cases debate
more broad@@ ly, we believe that the very serious question of the extra-territorial application of national american legislation should be raised to its full extent.
however, we do not feel that the programme can effectively deliver be@@ caus@@ e:
it is a dar@@ n sight more than can be said for the council.
i believe we are all agreed that the forthcoming icao general assembly meeting is going to be a key one as far as aviation and environment are concerned.
secondly, i wish to say that the 170 amendments reflect well on parliament's role as they reduce the administrative burden on companies in various way@@ s: by eliminating less relevant variab@@ les, by exempting some small and medium-sized companies from having to respond to surveys and by encouraging the use of administrative sources.
in fact, i intend to send a letter to the edit@@ or of the sunday te@@ leg@@ rap@@ h to protest against the newspaper publishing such serious and inaccurate information.
let us speak about the en@@ p.
so far, dci and e@@ id@@ hr have been the only financial instruments not to provide for an exception to the principle of the non-@@ eligibility of such costs.
with regard to the great fund for financing transport, of course i fully agree with mr izquierdo coll@@ ado that we need greater european funds in order to provide the support and promotion for the creation of infrastructures, in particular rail infrastructures, and for cur@@ ing bottle ne@@ cks in order to improve the use of european infrastructures.
the committee on legal affairs has therefore approved a total of 56 mand@@ ates.
i do not believe that commissioner bolkestein has now been transformed from a devil into an ange@@ l, for we did not see him as a devil and he is not an ange@@ l now, but a good piece of work has been done.
where the lives of europe's citizens are concerned, no minister and no council has the right to make high-@@ handed decisions.

they suffered terribly during the 19@@ 15 armenian genocide, and then again under the iraqi ha@@ sh@@ em@@ ite monarch@@ y for cooperating with the british during the first world war.
however, i would also like to recall, as v@@ é@@ ron@@ ique mathi@@ eu said, that the new powers granted to us in this area by the treaty of lisbon brought with them new obligations.
catastroph@@ ic, first of all, because it is based on a whole series of things which are unacceptable.
yet no one is accusing these countries of housing such camps, or voicing suspicions along these lines.
firstly, in relation to the scope of aid for trade, i want the measurement of the barroso billion to be against the existing base, which has two categor@@ i@@ es: one being trade policy and regulation, the other trade development.
the dialogue that has been entered into is thus a great opportunity, and i impl@@ ore all of you, let us adopt this dialogue together on a common platform supported by all the groups.

another important problem arises from the fact that the boom in textile exports from china has caused devastating effects in those developing countries whose principal and essential market for placing and selling their goods used to be the european union, which is now over@@ loaded with chinese goods.
finally, let me express my sincere thanks to all those colleagues who have worked on the draft budget now being presented and who have provided their encouragement and support.
this is where we, as europe's parliament, can certainly play an important role with these reports and these debates, and the ase@@ p summits could emphasise this.
in adopting the report on the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, parliament is showing that it is particularly sensitive to this issue and demonstrating a clear desire to find common, definitive solutions to the storage of nuclear waste in europe.
in my opinion the inclusion of micro@@ chips and the frequent exchange of driving licences as proposed by mr grosch entails unnecessary expense.
it could be deleted without causing any problems, together with chapter 4 and chapter 5. in that case, the rest of the proposal and the consultations would not be bad at all.
that concludes voting time.
of course, any deliberate atrocities against civilians by the military must be punished.
mr president, i am trying to be helpful.
i would call on the commission to examine this situation as a matter of urgency.
that is why this agreement should not lower environmental and social standards.
this is not exactly what has happened.
how could registration of a pharmaceutical already registered in another country be made cheaper and less bureaucr@@ atic@@ ?
it is the responsibility of the european union to provide the funding and the council ought to make decisions next friday.
dangerous goods can be more easily detected and made safe, and more clearly targeted investigation of fraudulent operations and prosecution of fraud@@ sters can be carried out.
meanwhile, european elections must be in line with the election systems in each member state.
it would be difficult to deny that the inquiry into the 11 september attacks is currently concentrating on europe and that it shows that, for years now, the terrorists have been centr@@ ing their preparations in europe, which they have used as their base.
we have taken due note of the european parliament’s opinion on this issue, especially that expressed in the recent resolution.
secondly, i should like to reject the argument that making the labour market more flexible would reduce the amount of undeclared work.
however, while i naturally agree with this in principle, i would also stress that we shall be in an entirely new situation.
does commissioner fischler want to be remembered as the archite@@ ct of a new and successful eu fisheries policy?
we patients are quite normal people on the whole.
perhaps it will be a convention after all.
thank you very much, mr prodi.
we are counting on you, mrs hübner, both at european and national level, to make a success of the six reports we are present@@ ing.
i am pleased to commend the excellent report of a colleague who, rather more than is custom@@ ary, took the views of his colleagues into account, and i am ashamed that there are only 25 of us at this sitting, a fact which hardly enhances the credibility of our debate.
cooperation through the network has been enhanced for all members, old and new.
but i should like to inform the house that we shall be putting in for a report.
the member states must not be discharged from their responsibiliti@@ es; the prevention of disasters is and remains a national responsibility, and it is for that reason that i take an extremely critical view of the eu's current acquisition of equipment, which represents what might be termed an attempt at duplic@@ ation, and certainly is not beneficial.
improvement has been possible thanks to the use of new technologies, but i believe that access is facilitated when information on accessibility is distributed as widely as possible.
the next item is the report by fried@@ rich@@ -@@ wil@@ helm graefe zu baringdorf, on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development, on the proposal for a council regulation on the measures to be undertaken by the commission in 2008-@@ 13 making use of the remo@@ te-@@ sen@@ sing applications developed within the framework of the common agricultural policy - c6-0@@ 27@@ 3/200@@ 7 -.
we will take account of it.
i would therefore like to make one point very clear: what i regard as being dishonest about this debate and about many of the speeches we have heard - including speeches made by mr putin, who used chechnya as the bloo@@ di@@ est election platform in history in order to come to power - is the word '@@ norm@@ alis@@ ation'.
it is becoming more and more expensive to achieve sustainable development, the longer we wait to take action.
the socialist group in the european parliament believes that, on a subject of such strategic importance, it would be highly advantageous to present to the commission and council a european parliament position with a broad basis of support.
this means that the european taxpayers pay out eur 30 billion every year for aviation, simply so that the airlines can offer inter@@ city flights at the same price as a short tax@@ i journey.

the eu regularly issues remin@@ ders as to the decisive role of the protection of intellectual property in business competitiveness.
i must confirm what the rapporteur has already said: the majority of experts still consider mercur@@ y-@@ containing blood pressure me@@ ters, sp@@ hy@@ g@@ mom@@ an@@ ome@@ ters, essential in the treatment of certain life-@@ threatening diseases.
this is not an easy situation.
this is the essence of the amendment tabled by our group: to seek improved information on the part of the services corresponding to this parliament to discover the true need for these buildings.

once again we see europe ham@@ str@@ inging business rather than liber@@ ating it.
the initiative has been accelerated and implementation is now star@@ ting.
we must convey to the world’s muslim communities that we wish to continue to work alongside them in developing a relationship built on trust.
this has clearly been the case with the programmes aimed at fostering mobility among students.
naturally, other issues remain, not least the university issue.
furthermore, as early as november 1996, the agriculture council committed itself to examining appropriate solutions for the particular situation of regions dependent on intensive stock@@ farming.
this is a question of human rights, democratic freedoms and the rights of the kurdish people in turkey.
it has therefore been necessary to harmonise member states' national laws relating to the admission and residence of those third-country nationals.
the budget is funding the extermination of small and medium-sized farming.
the ship belonging to the ‘@@ women on wav@@ es’ association also sai@@ led to poland, and its presence in poland was an incitement to criminal behaviour.
i should like to take advantage of commissioner michel@@ 's presence here to finish by saying that the commission will also need to step up its investigation into uncontrolled imports of chinese sho@@ es, which have created serious problems in european countries such as greece.
in addition, the proposal lays down streamlined and clearer criteria compared to those in the current decision.
modern family policy is about the equal responsibility of men and women for children and work.
moreover, it should also send a message to countries that are considering membership.

the committee on legal affairs does not have two positions.
i should like to draw your attention to three initiatives with which we are closely linked and which deserve special emphas@@ is: the eu-brazil summit, which has already taken place, the eu-africa summit and euro-@@ med meetings.
i stood here two, maybe three years ago talking about a silent, un@@ seen, painful and deb@@ ilit@@ ating female illness - end@@ ome@@ tri@@ os@@ is: an illness which destroys lives, families and ferti@@ lit@@ y; you see, some women do not even have the chance to be mothers.
our resolution says that we must urge all the countries in the region to refrain from activities directed against a neighbouring country, and so we must.
what we are talking about is the wiping out - the total extinction - of a particular species. the figures speak for themselves.
we have held long discussions with the belgian and hungarian presidencies in an attempt to achieve the necessary changes.
for example, if i have a product which can be produced using a minimum amount of water, or have a species of rice which contains specific vitam@@ ins, this is a matter of survival for many people in the developing countries.
the next privilege is immunity.
establishing guidelines for the collection and use of expertise is a further important commission measure to improve the way in which initiatives are prepared.
it is important that we as europeans say to the congres@@ sional leadership today: 'you do not stand alone.
there is disagreement over the electoral system and the timetable for the rebels to disarm has been ignored.
we feel that these issues result from the ig@@ c@@ ' s appropriateness and its objectives, as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there.
they must stop or we should stop the aid.
we need to have a concrete example of your commitment.
for legislation on the budget - and decisions on the budget are another very important prerogative of parliament - there will surely be a need for a special procedure, but the principle of codecision should remain the same.
during the meal our host was called to the teleph@@ one, and he was asked to come to the hospital as quickly as possible because his el@@ dest son had been involved in a road accident.
there is also a widespread perception that a series of global challenges, such as peace, security and international trade, require concerted action on the part of the international community, thereby justifying the emergence of new forms of cooperation.
i believe that is the right approach and we need to strengthen it.
firstly, i should like to congratulate catherine traut@@ mann for the work that she has done so far as rapporteur on the directive amending the framework directives on '@@ access@@ ' and '@@ authoris@@ ation'.
commissioner, i should just like to ask you if the same phenomenon applies to other products, i.e. if there are co@@ ding systems for other products, because the culture industry is extremely sensitive, there is huge competition from america, which we are unable to with@@ stand, as we know all too well.
among other equally important points, i feel that there are valid reasons to support the presentation of proposals on forms of socio-economic compensation for those affected by fishing restrictions and limits on exports of european e@@ el.
and this is important and necessary.
the centres need sound legal advice on the legal merits of the problems submitted and the solutions proposed.
this whole point has a lot of merit.
the clear and unequivocal demand set out in recital j of the report for clinical trials and comprehensive, scientific tests of effectiveness to be adopted as a prerequisite for the recognition of non-conventional medical disciplines is very much to be welcomed.
announcement by the president
the figures shown in the communication on the single market adopted by the commission last october are quite clear: by liberalising services, we would obtain a 4% growth in gross domestic product gdp over the next 10 years.
we are in fact somewhat concerned about the future evolution of the andean community, in that venezue@@ la@@ ’s recent announcement of its seces@@ sion from it raises questions that need to be elu@@ ci@@ dated and answered on both the political and legal level.
additional funds from community instruments such as the structural funds and the cohesion fund are also available for the purpose mentioned by the honourable member.
we must continue to encourage tajikistan to introduce a programme of reforms.
we are not, after all, treating this as a marginal issue; every time it meet@@ s, the council considers how progress can be made.
this means that at the centre of the union, there is a need for an enlarged functional and cohesive market and for better transportation corridors in that area.
we think the problem must be considered at european level, for some people are rightly questioning the competitiveness of companies and we want to know your level of commitment to agreements on the 35 hour week, and indeed what you think of the prescriptive route.
terrorism will triumph if we sacrifice the rule of law, personal integrity and the protection of human rights.
we cannot take a decision until we have all the information available as to implementation.
our objective has been and will continue to be a single market with choice, quality and low prices for all european businesses and consumers.
this is true, but ukraine remains a state even after these elections.
i feel i share your state of mind and can understand the reasons why you raised your voice a little in making a demand which i am sure is endorsed by all colleagues, or at least those who are present in the chamber at the moment.
. i just want to thank you for these contributions.
instead, we will follow our european legal cultures and take into account the existing experiences of member states.
in the allocation of speaking time it says: ' 3 to 6 p.m., 9 to 12 mid@@ night, excluding the commission statement on b@@ se@@ ' .
. in a society that is based on democratic values, i believe that each party should be accorded the same rights.
however, i have decided that i really cannot come to strasbourg any longer.
the house has examined the problems of the common fisheries policy on numerous occasions in the past.
unfortunately, mr bourlanges, in the tex@@ t's philosophical and theoretical sub@@ conscious - for example, in paragraph 5, second indent - we can discer@@ n a terrible distrust of the small and medium-sized states which makes me unwilling at the present time to adopt the report, for various and quite straightforward reasons.
mr president, i rise, not in the normal way to contribute to the debate, but because earlier this afternoon the debate on kosovo was curtai@@ led and there was a certain degree of chaos because we were trying to get the statements from the president-in-office of the council and from the commission, and contributions from members of the political groups.
i do believe that this really is now the time for european institutions to deal with this problem more seriously.
the situation for italy and libya is, of course, something which my colleagues from italy will speak more about, but this principle must not be violated by anyone or any country.
however, it must not result in an unjust taxation situation in which some well-@@ advised and mobile citizens evade their fiscal obligations, whilst the more se@@ dent@@ ary citizens remain subject to them.
it is, of course, a matter for member states to organise their arrangements regarding rural post offices as they see fit and in line with their own requirements.
in this context, i believe that member states should be encouraged to devise tax incentives for end-@@ users, so as to encourage them to invest in greener cars.
however, the world cup is an illustration of the extreme contrasts in our world. between the fit and healthy children who copy the world cup on the streets in the richer world and the children on the indian sub@@ continent who sti@@ tch together leather footb@@ alls in swe@@ at@@ shops all day long.
european defence has been the dream of many simple@@ -minded individuals throughout the twentieth century but nothing has been achieved.
. – madam president, commissioner, mr star@@ k, the vice-president of the deutsche bundes@@ bank, is a convincing candidate for the executive board of the european central bank.
otherwise, the legitimate call for respect for a minority is in danger of turning into a form of reverse discrimination, to the detriment of all those honest citizens who suffer the crimes and abuses of many roma.
it is encouraging to see that the commission proposal for an end to double taxation of cars for people who move around the eu has resulted from a number of petitions to this european parliament.
mr president, the commission is glad to know that ms od@@ d@@ y's report, which is very thorough, shares the approach and the main lines of the commission's proposal.
but with the council and the governments on either side, in the council and in parliament, what need is there for parliament?
we can use the imf and the world bank as the treasu@@ rer of this operation, and use the un as the honest brok@@ er.
these are arbitr@@ ary, in@@ significant, incoherent proposals, sometimes dictated by the national political agenda, and transform the third pillar into an ever-@@ expanding univer@@ se, containing chaos in all dire@@ ction@@ s; a bureaucratic ball of thread without ends.
to put it bluntly, we do not yet have a majority for it.
the global warming theory has cast co@@ 2, a natural constituent of the atmosphere, as a dem@@ on gas.
mr president, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, i should like to begin by paying tribute to the work of both the rapporteur, mrs gr@@ ä@@ ß@@ le, and the drafts@@ man, mr pa@@ hor@@ , and by congratulating them on the quality of their report.
and to those who are worri@@ ed, let me say again that i have seen no sign of any proposal that any member state should not have a commissioner.
this is a particularly interesting point when we take account of the fact that, with this reduction in environmental pollution, we would also be fulfilling the commitments made at the kyoto conference on climate change.
year after year, the budget of the european union increases and yet the amounts devoted to fishing in general, and to the fisheries agreements in particular, are not growing to the same extent but are diminishing in relative and indeed absolute terms - from ecu 27@@ 8 million to ecu 27@@ 3 million last year.
it is up to us as law@@ makers to draw up rules aimed at limiting the impact of climate change.
there needs to be more rationalisation of the budget, more exposure to competition, more deregulation and a more rapid phasing-out of monopolies.
does this not contradict the principle of technological neutr@@ al@@ ity?
up to now, proposals for this have always failed at council level, as the national regulatory systems were so hetero@@ gene@@ ous, and the frameworks and aid structures so diver@@ se, that no common denominator could be found.
if you indulge me, may i take the opportunity to thank the representatives of the presidency for all the help and assistance they have given my colleagues over the recent months.

we need to change the process and procedures to ensure that we have a coherent common foreign and security policy.

madam president, commissioner, our experiences of recent days involving the al@@ stom affair remind me a little of the story of the man who, when he was asked why he kept hitting himself on the head with a ham@@ mer, replied that it was because it felt so good when it stopped.
if we think about the precautionary principle and prevention, it becomes clear that incentives must be created to encourage companies to have their products tested.
it seems to me that referring to subsidiarity in this context is too simpl@@ is@@ tic.
there are many interests at stake, with many interested parties involved, and, as you yourself, mr monti, recently mentioned in the committee on economic and monetary affairs, some of these interested parties will stop at nothing in their attempt to organise future car sales in the way that suits them best.
the high level of tax in europe weakens the economy and is not leaving private citizens enough room to manoeuvre or enough dispos@@ able income to boost consumer spending.
can you tell us what is happening with that? do you have a date when these measures will be in place?
as if the agreements with argentina, morocco or mauritania were not enough to show how community fishing activities have contributed to the development of this sector in third countries, the new protocol with guinea clearly shows the benefits a coastal country can gain from a fishing agreement with the community.
it is certainly not a partial freezing of meda funds which will cause the turkish government to have a change of heart.
while there is now closer cooperation between the security forces throughout the world, there is no international consensus on minimum standards in relation to fundamental rights and legal protection.
there is a great deal of opposition in greece to the austerity measures, and so it is highly likely that the country will be suc@@ ked into a negative growth spir@@ al, with sharply declining consumer spending even though an increase in that spending is actually needed to pay off the loans plus interest.
i went for a walk across the bridge from strasbourg in france to ke@@ h@@ l in germany and i stopped and med@@ it@@ ated.
whatever may be thought about this language dispute, this case will never become relevant to the eu's charter of fundamental human rights because the charter is aimed at the eu and at the member states when administering eu policy, and as we are aware, the eu has no policy on railway sign@@ age.
i am sorry if people are starting to be made to feel guilty about their feelings or pho@@ bi@@ as.
on behalf of the alde group. - mr president, i, too, would like to congratulate mrs ţică@@ u, who has worked with tremendous dedication on this dossier.
for example, it identifies the long-distance transport of agricultural products and retail goods as un@@ desirable.
on the contrary, we view the new member states as a resource.
i have my own thoughts for you also.
let me begin with trade, because quite a lot of the different contributions focused on that.
this report, completely re@@ modelled by mrs gutiérre@@ z, is satisfactory.
i believe the problem must be approached with due caution but also putting the issues back into proportion.
the data under the pnr agreement will be retained for 15 years, which, i put to you, is excessive and which this report says we do not want.
i personally would like to insist on the need to harmonize not only the conditions of access but also the working conditions for road transport operators.
according to the latest eurobarometer surve@@ ys, 8@@ 9% of european citizens are concerned about the impact of the environment on their health.
the fact is that you have accepted a ban on the substance we are speaking about for certain obje@@ cts, for example tee@@ thing r@@ ings.
this will clearly be of enormous significance for honourable members in the coming electoral process and, as i have indicated, we will be sending people out very shortly.
the word "@@ mic@@ he@@ lin@@ " does not appear in any of the language ver@@ sions, apart from the english. i would therefore ask you to keep the german or french versions as they are and take a vote on them.
let me again stress how far-reaching these reforms are.
we also know that the united states has not acceded to this agreement, so a major international trading nation is missing.
i only need to respond to a few of the speeches.
what is most uncertain in the decision is control by the european parliament.
the responsibilities of the european union and the so-called '@@ international community' are hu@@ ge.
there is now a need to throw real light on all these replies.
there are tens of thousands of participants in the community projects.
i would also like to welcome commissioner michel and to underline his call for good cooperation with our committee on development.
we cannot have 19th or 20th century solutions.
madam president, i shall resist the temptation to reject automatically as in@@ sidi@@ ous or worth@@ less any agreement between two sets of supporters of 'the project@@ ', as it is called.
all this is by way of general comment.
we thank you, president borrell fon@@ tell@@ es, for the opportunity of being here and we look forward to working with each and every one of your countries in the coming months and into the future.
minimum eu rates of duty are sensible and effective in tackling the scourge of smuggling.
the fund has to be streamlined in order to sta@@ ve off this sort of hopeless situation.
the present text, which allows the proposal to be adopted at second reading, only puts forward various technical addi@@ tions.
in addition, many villages and houses have been burnt out and stocks of food and medicines are dimin@@ ishing.
having carefully examined the recommendation for second reading concerning biome@@ tr@@ ics and visa applications with regard to common consular instru@@ ctions, i have decided to vote in favour.
this witness has been missing since september, and this has caused huge alarm amongst the many witnesses who must carry on testi@@ fying in order to reveal the truth and in order to ensure that no crime goes unpunished.
i cannot comment on them.
even basic information on pollution was labelled a state secret.
madam president, the common challenges which stand before africa and the european union are clear and unequivo@@ cal.
i am pleased that the slovenian presidency is making good progress.
the influence of events in building tension in that atmosphere is also very concerning, as it shows that this is not an entirely spontaneous phenomenon or simply the result of clash@@ es, but that in many cases it is being orchestrated to hide the real social problems affecting people.
we can do that and there is a precedent.
when the figures for 2000 are examined, it can be seen that there were errors in seven per cent of the documents.

better coordination within the commission, a strengthening of the council's authority over human rights issues and greater cooperation with the european parliament, all these would be very welcome moves indeed.
it is important, however, that we do not allow ourselves to become prisoners of old ideas.
i should like to ask the commissioner one question.
the commission' s plans to monitor the policy efforts and policy results at national level more closely are well-@@ intended but will probably have the opposite effect, especially if this is done by means of a quantitative approach: counting the number of measures, aid schemes and employment projects.

the principle of transparency must also apply to what is known as comitology. we therefore feel that only advisory committees should be maintained.

the european union must mobilise the entire pan@@ op@@ ly of instruments at its disposal to support south sudan in the delicate post-@@ referendum phase.
i therefore obviously support the proposals aimed at repealing the sector@@ ial directives, which were supposed to be temporary and have often continued longer than necessary, resulting in serious restrictions to the freedom of movement and freedom of establishment of european citizens across the union.

member states are already allowed to grant fiscal incentives, provided that they comply with state aid rules, particularly the guidelines on state aid for environmental protection, as well as on commission notice on the application of the state aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation.

nevertheless, i consider proportionality to constitute a fundamental principle of data protection policy.
i believe that there is a lot of work yet to be done in institutional terms between council, commission and parliament to prevent this from slipping out of the community sphere, with the result that the finance ministers become the new masters of europe.

then, i should like to tell the french presidency that it can count on parliament' s support to prefer rather that we have no nice agreement than a mediocre treaty.

it is, of course, open to discussion how the definition in terms of the words '@@ serious environmental cri@@ me' and '@@ substantial dam@@ age' is to be interpre@@ ted, but that is no doubt as far as the definition goes, even if it is not recognisable in legislation outside the member states.
why should we make life even more difficult for these famili@@ es?
madam president, ladies and gentlemen, commissioner, i think it is rather fantastic that we have now brought about some pretty good legislation.
we can be proud of our response so far to this rapidly changing landscape.
our work on the value of sport, on social and educational sport, will help to bring this about.
looking beyond the technical, administrative and practical aspects associated with the actual implementation of the initiative, i believe that our message must, above all, be political.
in this connection, however, the meeting of the ecofin council held on 13 september last finally seemed to produce encouraging results.
fishermen from other countries use nets up to 2.5 kilometres long and in the bay of bis@@ c@@ ay nets up to 25 kilometres are allowed.
the commission must take account of the special character of the g@@ da@@ ń@@ sk shipyard and give it special treatment.

cooperation among member states and with countries and regions from the eu neighbourhood such as the black sea, baltic and mediterranean opens up opportunities to prevent trans@@ border pollution.
i have not voted in favour of the motion for a resolution, because in my opinion it is primarily a statement of opposition to the right-wing government and does not take an un@@ biased approach to the problem.
the main way to ensure that the individual participants in the stock market act along the same lines is through harmonization and not through voluntary codes of conduct.
if there are problems with the current system of cross-@@ compliance, how are we going to address the potential of further problems if we deepen the requirements on the environmental side of pillar one, which is something contained in the leaked document on the reform of the cap@@ ?
mr president, ladies and gentlemen, this may appear to be a technical report, but in fact it is a very political one, and i should like to thank mrs oomen-ruijten for taking a step in the right direction.

madam president, honourable members, allow me, at this point, to make a brief comment on behalf of the council and express how very depressing this topic is for all of us.

in our individual member states, and collectively as the european union, we must exert whatever pressure we can to bring the government and far@@ c back to the negotiating table, under a real ceasefire agreement genuinely observed by all parties to the conflict.

there are 40 spanish factory vessels in the irish box as we speak.
it has decided to close down a profitable sugar refin@@ ery on the swedish island of got@@ land and is putting obstacles in the way of someone who is interested in taking over the refin@@ er@@ y.

indeed, europe has contributed a very large amount.
kick us out@@ !

commissioner, you know that the european parliament has repeatedly prote@@ ste@@ d, with the presidency's bless@@ ing, in order to highlight the importance of farming and preserved food in the region of mur@@ cia, against attacks on lorry drivers and products from mur@@ cia in france.

most of our goals were echoed in both mr diamandou@@ ros@@ ’ and mr de ros@@ sa@@ ’s report; however, there are lots of areas to be further improved in order to provide the best possible service to citizens.
most of us contribute constructively on an everyday basis to the attainment of that goal.
thanks to the euro, we europeans now enjoy greater macroeconomic stability, lower interest rates and much more moderate price rises than in previous decades, despite the recent rise in inflation.
we must not allow people to go on dying in the waters of the mediterranean.
my second point - and this has already been touched upon - is that the commission's centralisation dri@@ ve, pursued by means of the authority, the right of veto and comitology procedure, must be firmly resis@@ ted.

in fact, the member states' contributions are currently paid in national currency and then have to be converted into ecu.
moreover, with the everything but arms arrangement, market access to the eu is free for the least developed countries, and the provisions of the economic partnership agreements epas show an understanding of problems faced by many of the acp countries in guaranteeing food security to their citizens.

i invite everyone to read what she said on the previous randzio-plath report. this provides the definite answer.
it is highly impro@@ per, to my mind, to start giving out generous levels of state aid and subsidies, whilst we have not yet sorted out other measures, including patents, making the labour market more flexible, opening up the market for services and many other measures of this kin@@ d; mistakes like this cannot be put right with state aid.
particularly interesting in my view is that this discussion can and must actually be taken further by means of an amendment.
because this is what it says: ' members must declare the assist@@ an@@ ce' - a fine expression - ' that they recei@@ ve' . the problem is not whether or not i declare it.

the simplification of the common agricultural policy remains an important task.
however, i would also like to pose the question of how sustainable the agreement is that is now being signalled at the beginning of this year by this report.

mr president, madam commissioner, the first thing i want to do is congratulate mr izquierdo coll@@ ado on his report on the tri@@ enn@@ ial report on economic and social cohesion.
the commission feels that any lasting solution will require a genuine immigration policy to be gradually established. this policy must take account of the union' s views on social, economic and demographic developments, and will consequently guarantee the admission of migrants under an organised and clear framework, as well as their harmonious integration into the communities that receive them.

the draft guarantees an adequate field of vision through the wind@@ screen and other windows on the motor vehic@@ le, which, from the point of view of general safety, is to be endorsed without exception.
european countries have performed very well in the inter-parliamentary union’s assessment of participation in governments, even though women’s participation stands at only 10% in france and italy.

on the other hand, the establishment of a system of conces@@ sion@@ ary fares for certain passenger categories, such as members of large families, remains a matter for the member states.
for, as my fellow member, mrs madeira, just said, if we are responsible for solidarity, then we must shoulder that responsibility within the context of our powers.
the government in lithuania cannot come to a decision, because it is good economic business to operate this plant.

we recognise that the political context in which discussions on future financing should take place would be better served by having had a prior conversation about the future direction of europe, which is why we have organised the informal heads of government meeting tomorrow.

we are unable to back the majority of the amendments because they would, in fact, render the regulation superfluous and the ex@@ am in@@ effective, and we should thus be over@@ shooting our target.
the human rights situation in the southern and eastern southern basin of the mediterranean has not improved.
the international institutions and international law of today were shaped and created in a completely different world.
in addition, i assume the commission is going to change the rules in order to prevent a similar problem occurring in future.
i believe that there is a thread running through all the speeches given by my fellow members. this thread is the importance of the committee on petitions, because the faith and hopes of thousands of europeans that their principal and real problems can be solved often rest on this committee.
i should like to point out to my fellow members that, for as long as greece is in economic crisis, no government will agree to start negotiations in the council and the proof of greece's good faith was demonstrated when it agreed to this country's candidat@@ ure.
more recently, i have read advertisements from insurance companies wish@@ ing, under certain circumstances, to in@@ sure for any damage resulting from a failure, which shows that even in this field offers have become available.

in my opinion, europe's security can best be promoted by preserving the current basic military security structures and by developing pan-european and transatlantic security cooperation on that basis within the framework of the osce, the n@@ ac@@ c and the partnership for peace.
the fact is, however, that there are some differences of opinion on how far this work should go.
we are sick and tired of lies from people who sit and hide things from europe's taxpayers.
the commissioner knows that and i know that.
i do not conceal the fact that we are also carrying out this operation because this is one of the rare cases of the world - mercosur plus chile - where the european union is a major economic and trade partner and the main invest@@ or, even ahead of the united states and japan.

as the commission report makes clear, croatia has also made some substantial progress in meeting the negotiating benchmar@@ ks, and the country's commitment to the eu's expectations remains strong.
however, at this stage, the commission's proposals are totally unrealistic.
the proposal reduces the administrative burden on small and medium-sized enterprises, but - and i think it is important to say this - it does this without reducing investor protection.

when discussions take place between institutions, that is a good question to raise in that context.
we believe that more confidence should be placed in local politicians.
in unle@@ ashing the power of the single market in a sector that comprises probably 70% of the european economy, the jobs that it will create, and the dynamic effect of that, are sorely needed at the moment in the stagn@@ ant conditions that we face.
most seriously of all, however, it does not recognise the need for a balance between the environment@@ -related economic and social indicators and the fact that the council meeting in gothenburg established a strategy for sustainable development by adding an environmental dimension to the existing lisbon process.
mr president, ladies and gentlemen, i should like to highlight the in@@ comple@@ teness of the report, which talks about immigrant@@ s’ rights without, however, referring to their obligations.
it is no accident that this document, which i shall discuss briefly a little later, is entitled "the monterrey consensu@@ s" .
due to this policy, the rural population is already seven times smaller than in 195@@ 0.
the spread of technology does not mean automatic sharing of opportunities and the enormous benefits.
it is also our sincere hope that the enlarging european union will play an important part in this whole debate and will contribute its experience of problems and opportunities in integrating these various aspects of policy into general policy on a multinational basis.
mr president, on behalf of the socialist group i would like to say that we supported approval of the interinstitutional agreement as an essential building block in re-establishing the credibility of the european union in how it relates to fraud and deals with allegations of fraud.
for this reason, i would strongly urge the commission to put every euro this programme has been granted to the most effective use possible and ensure that there is a one hundred per cent implementation rate.
it is essential that we press the iranian authorities to systematically commu@@ te all death penalties for juvenile offenders at the very least, and to halt the execution of the four young boys who are awaiting execution at this moment.
in energy production, the highest numbers of casualties have been reported in locations where dam@@ s have bur@@ st.

furthermore, it is quite likely that the european modern and contemporary art market, which is of particular significance for london, will be moved to switzerland. this was, in fact, already evident a few weeks ago at the basel art fair.
the chinese authorities have recently imposed tighter cur@@ bs on the foreign press, making it subject to strict internal rules.
- pl madam president, the middle east also has its christian roots.

my colleague, commissioner mandelson, who is responsible for trade policy, visited china recently and had the opportunity to discuss the issue with high-ranking chinese officials, including the deputy prime minister, who expressed their commitment to the fight against counterfeiting.

this resolution must also make a firm request to council to adopt a decision on the proposed regulation of the solidarity fund, to facilitate a quicker and more effective response to disasters that member states are unable to deal with alone.
one of the speakers here said there are clearly institutional shortages in this area.
those are objectives of the governments and, already with the meetings which took place yesterday and further meetings today and tomorrow, we are working towards those objectives.
i reiterate that the eu must have a consistent approach and should not extradite individuals to countries where they may be at risk of incur@@ ring the death penalty.
it is thus absolutely clear that there is an urgent need, above all, for consistent action.
– mr president, even though we are all ree@@ ling from the terrorist act in spain, there is a matter on which i would ask you to provide the members of this house with full information.
obviously we are in favour, i am in favour, of zero tolerance, but, if you will forgive me, there is, on the other hand, no such thing as zero risk.
as regards the stockholm programme, we are strengthening and tightening up the regulations for data protection and respect for the rights of individuals, and democracy, too, in a number of different respects.
indeed, as a member of the european parliament who represents the east coast of ireland, this is an issue which is close to my heart.
the issues of echo, tourism and meda have their origins in initiatives and special reports by the court of auditors.
i get the impression that the group of the european people's party christian democrats and european democrats is still living in the past.
last year, we had a rather more pleasant duty to perform on behalf of the member states.
if our foreign ministers had experienced for themselves this atmosphere of a country re@@ awak@@ en@@ ing, as i did last thursday night, they would probably offer even more support for this democratic revival and also threaten - and actually impose - more stringent sanctions on milosevic and his government.
it is also clear that the member states have a very important responsibility and that a great deal depends on them and on how much they are prepared to put into creating real european aviation and a real european aviation industry.
it is a problem that is fairly widespread.
i shall not comment on the case in question, since it is su@@ b judic@@ e and it is not customary for the commission to comment on such cases, but i would like to give you a clear explanation of the commission' s policy on the issue of transmissible diseases affecting developing countries.
people are moving across borders to take up jobs, some people are reti@@ ring to other areas and an increasing number of people are working for periods in other member states.
improve the transparency of estimates and responsibility of project@@ s;
mr president, thank you very much for this debate.
it is a decision which has yet to be implemented.
such a directive is needed, because it will result in unification of legislation in this area and will bring together at union level all the efforts being made to protect the soil.
pl mr president, commissioner, we are today discussing very important issues of employment, social rights and health protection.
look at the uk's superior employment figures noted just now.
on this point, we must insist not only that our aid should be massive but that our programmes such as tacis should be better adap@@ ted, better monitored and better coordinated with programmes carried out by our member states or by financial organizations such as the imf, the ebrd or the eib.
the european union's recovery measures are accompanied by mandatory measures of financial pru@@ dence.
i can assure you, mr president, ladies and gentlemen, that i firmly believe that it is the commission's fundamental task to act as the guardian of the treaties.
the rapporteur states that we need an improvement in pre-school education, which is when people form their habits and skills needed for later learning.
i repeat, mr president, and i will finish with this, that as regards the helms-burton or d'@@ amato acts, the united states did not pay as much attention to our concerns as we are paying to theirs.
that would only serve to fuel the sense among our peoples that the eu remains obli@@ vious to their concerns and priorities.
i would like to focus on two core issues to which i was committed as the rapporteur.
mr president, i hoped to be able to say something before mrs van dij@@ k left.
furthermore, i ask of the commission: is, in their view, the award of eur 4 million to the fishermen by the french government state aid, and would it therefore be anti-competitive and unlawful within the rules of the common fisheries policy?
madam president, ladies and gentlemen, the commission has presented a proposal amending for the fourth time the fifg implementing regulation ec no 36@@ 99@@ /9@@ 3.
how, for example, does the provision of an article of the charter of fundamental rights that says that '@@ any discrimination based on ... political or any other opinion ... shall be prohibi@@ te@@ d' square with the forci@@ ble s@@ nat@@ ching of pieces of paper with the leg@@ end '@@ referendu@@ m' from the hands of member@@ s?
at present, two thirds of energy resources are imported from countries outside the eu, mainly russia.
it is not enough for us to say that we wish to monitor the activities and function of lobbyists.
we are about to approve the european union budget for 2011, which is being done, for the first time, in accordance with the new regime of the treaty of lisbon.
one point that mrs fourtou also mentioned, and with which i agree, is that the directive should not of course create any barriers to competition.
the experiment has also contributed to combating illegal work.
european farmers are operating under strict health and safety criteria.
this is why i voted in favour of this report.
there are a huge number of romanian children who live with their families in other member states and it is important for them to preserve their identity and to be offered the chance to study both the language of the country they are living in and their mother tongue.
if you look at parliament's di@@ ary for 1997, you will find that 8 and 15 september are actually sun@@ days and week@@ -@@ ending days, not week@@ -@@ beginning days.
we members of parliament tried, we made a proposal that the council itself should come up with an end date.
nonetheless, we - and by that i mean europe and the usa - must remain faithful to the implementation of the roadmap.
ladies and gentlemen, the agreement on prevention from sharp injuries is historically the first agreement between sectoral social partners.
the council stated that the need for eu legislation should be noted, and particularly the need for legislation on the recycling of bio@@ degra@@ dable waste by means of com@@ posting and energy recovery in biogas facilities with subsequent recycling of residual material.
it cannot be right, as we approach so important a decision as that on the european constitution, that there should be no campaign of information and explanation, or at least no long-term one.
as the powers that be in ukraine are obviously not unanimous in their desire to shut down chernobyl, we should agree with the rapporteur's view on the commission's responsibility.
it is therefore a compliment that the paper has actually been written and adopted.
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
this is why this report is important as it forms a link in the chain of discussions and cooperation concerning improvements in the adoption of minors.
as the irish had their chance of rejecting the treaty at this juncture, all the other member states must have an opportunity to move forward, so that the irish can return to their decision when the time is ri@@ pe.
however, there is a wide body of opinion which believes that a democratic state starts and ends with a multi-@@ party system and regular elections.
we are so far behind schedule that it is essential to find a way out of the situation that would enable us to use the sis 1@@ + network after 13 november 2008, i.e. to extend the service provided by the sis@@ net network and to create a fall@@ -back solution with the s-@@ test@@ a network.
but, aside from these observations, the presentation of the budget must be praised as being excellent and thoroughly appro@@ v@@ able.
we think it is better for us to make labour standards an integral part of our other policy areas, such as development cooperation.
you stated this very clearly and power@@ fully and thus sent a message of confidence to the people of austria and to all the other peoples of europe.
i am referring to the requirements concerning contain@@ ers, which are also mentioned in the report by my colleague mr aud@@ y.
as you know, this process started last november.
it is a far more complex and urgent matter, however to reform the individual structures of the eu as items of budgetary finance.
finally, the members of parliament were not sufficiently involved in the preparatory coordination work.
the sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalan@@ che of mergers and acquisi@@ tions, leading inevitably to monopoly situations.
it gives us the chance to consider how to prevent wron@@ gs within the european institutions.
we therefore consider that culture contributes directly towards the development of the cultural education of europeans and indirectly towards economic prosperity, especially in the regions which are most in need of focus and development.
this is why i doubt the value of mr colaj@@ anni@@ 's report.
that is why, more than anything else today, we need to put this regulation in place.
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
we must address this issue in the debate on the treaty.
it seems obvious to me that this proposal is anticipating the possible accession of turkey.
in this connection, the question also arises of whether the profitable direct mail sector is to be opened up or not.
furthermore, the majority of these resources must be allocated with a view to involving civil society in the partner countries in common projects and to supporting the mobility of their citizens.
whilst, to a certain extent, a number of the amendments which have been proposed to the report improve the situation, there are still one or two issues which need to be addressed, in my opinion.
as regards the first draft of the council budget, i would like to mention that the commission, when it presented its version, referred to the forecasts of the member states using our analysis.
you should say that the current treaties cannot be revo@@ ked unilater@@ ally, and that withdrawal from the eu is possible only with the consent of all member states; and that, consequently, no member state can be excluded from the eu without its own consent.
reducing vat on services up to the end of this year was the right way to go about it.
one obvious example is the amendment designed to permit a division of the daily rest period into four distinct parts.
thus it is our obligation to do this.
to my mind, however, the immediate conclusion is both simple and alarm@@ ing: all the indications are that the situation with regard to the stock is very much worse than the most optimistic forecasts.
we intend to put the issue of energy efficiency on the agenda, and we will talk about renewable energies. the german eu presidency will appeal for the adoption of specific figures and reduction approaches which are binding.
mrs frassoni pointed out how ridiculous it is to have a situation in which we have 14 000 diplom@@ ats, whilst the united states has 3 000, with the cost@@ /@@ quality ratio of which we are fully aware.
fourthly, i want to make it clear that with this directive we are agreeing a level to which the applicant countries of the former communist bloc in central and eastern europe will have to ad@@ here, and for which they must now prepare themselves.
mr president, ladies and gentlemen, once again it has proved impossible for a delegation from the european parliament to visit the occupied part of cyprus under acceptable conditions in order to form their own judgement of the circumstances under which the greek cypriots and mar@@ on@@ ites are living in the encla@@ ves there.
without investment in europe's rural infrastructure, the eu would not function as it does today.
on this basis, we should to a greater degree be measuring results instead of input.
it sets up mechanisms through which the european union will now be able to entren@@ ch its integration.
now to the second issue; you spoke about electric cars.
it is of course a particular pleasure for me to be able to report on the validation of the mandates of all the members in question, and i believe that not only the chairman of the committee on legal affairs but the whole of parliament may welcome the entry of the meps for the new member states.
the opinion of the committee on the environment, and i quote, ' insists that at present the european union does not have the know-how or experience needed to establish such network@@ s.'
my basic premise is that the range of measures under the common agricultural policy must be developed in a way that takes the special conditions prevailing in northern agricultural areas into greater consideration.
a first job depends very much on that essential link between the institutions offering education and training and the requirements of the labour market.
the vote will take place at the end of the debate.
on our side we should be prepared to respond with a system of european civil justice which does not, as i have said earlier, just add insult to injur@@ y.
our view is that the union cannot accept this kind of blackma@@ il, but must carry out its specific role in the peace process without being treated just as a dispen@@ ser of funds and cas@@ h.
furthermore, i would like to draw your attention to the fact that the single market, on its own, is not a guarantee for europe's success in the globalisation development process.
i am confident that their mission will provide greater trust in the election process and their observations will help confirm the transparency and impartiality of the workings of ukrainian institutions.
i am convinced that the stu@@ bb@@ /@@ friedrich report will eliminate all kinds of prejudices and negative views about lobbying and that european citizens will view lobbyists as specialists who bring knowledge based on practical experience, helping to prevent european legislation from having a negative impact.
the time has truly come to step us the measures.
i think these are two entirely distinct debates, which should have taken place at separate times during this strasbourg part-session, and each one should have been given the importance it deserves.
the bank is still very unwilling to open its accounts and projects up to external supervision.
in the final vote on both the amended proposal and the legislative resolution, it should say '@@ free vo@@ tes@@ '.
this crisis will not be short-@@ li@@ ved.
it is a country rarely mentioned in lists of examples or in key speeches, yet its fate is closely bound up with the european union.
. el the terrorist attack on the usa gives us an incentive to look at the problem of arms exports in a new light.
it is with this in mind that i hope that my committee will be backed up by parliament@@ 's, the commission's and the council's own proposals.
ladies and gentlemen, the eu’s most recent enlargement brought a number of changes to the fruit and vegetable market.
- oral question b6-00@@ 10@@ /2004 by il@@ da figueiredo, francis wurtz, ev@@ a-@@ brit@@ t sven@@ sson, miguel port@@ as and s@@ ér@@ gio ribe@@ i@@ ro, on the ban on entry into portugal of ‘@@ women on wav@@ es’ bo@@ at.
however, we hope that the word '@@ war@@ ' will be targeted against very specific fr@@ inge members of the arab world, for the arab world as a whole does not deserve to be treated as criminal because of the criminal actions of a tin@@ y, criminal minority of delin@@ qu@@ ents who are stateless because of their own inten@@ tional, sen@@ sel@@ ess, barbaric lun@@ acy.
the problems will not necessarily solve themselves if we do not talk about them.
if this case is symptomatic of legal practice in turkey, neither the commission nor the council should proceed to the agenda.
to conclude, i appreciate receiving the conclusions of parliament and look forward to coming to you with proposals for change later in the year.
that request for urgency was approved.
from my own experience, i know that once someone has been there for five years, they will find it very difficult to leave their host country again.
it is indeed the case that enough in@@ k has been used up on the subject of the future of the lisbon process.
we will have to take the worst of both world@@ s: a serious reduction in production with the associated consequences for the economy, including unemployment in our vital agri@@ food sector, and the anticipated market vacuum filled by third-country imports.
the good qualities of the commission and the commissioners are not in question - the problem runs deeper than that.
this budget also supports employment.
d'@@ 66 demands democratic control over european agricultural policy.
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
i would also like to thank mr fava and parliament once again for having enabled this compromise.
only in this way is the member of parliament able to exercise control.
mr president, it is regrettable, of course, that the first news we had of this report was in the media, as happened last year.
the child is thoroughly confused and lives shut up in a cell@@ ar.
who is to be blamed for this massive sacrifice of human life@@ ?
however, the report does not inspire trust. it makes no distinction between consumption of fin@@ ite resources and impact on climate.
i was personally very upset about the death of orlando zap@@ at@@ a, and i would therefore like, on behalf of the entire ecr group, to express condolences to all of his family.
mr president, i would like to begin by thanking mr garcía-margallo y mar@@ fil for his report. i would also like to thank all those members of parliament involved for their active cooperation in its production.
but there were other points, too, points which i had identified as priorities in my pre-@@ florence address to this house, where progress has been made.
this is not the first time that the commission and parliament have tackled this issue: i will only cite here the commission' s report to the council and parliament, published in may 1998, which did not accept israel@@ ' s refusal to apply the protocol of the rules of origin as laid down in article 3@@ 8.
fifthly, we want a similar instrument to the t@@ ft@@ p, to be introduced in addition at eu level, and, sixthly, we are of the opinion that this is the precondition to reciprocity.
we need to make use of the union's military logistics – not just for member states – to assist in the accessible areas affected and to invest in capacities and their rapid implementation in similar emergencies in the future.
we have also sent documents to the committee on budgetary control even though it is difficult for the commission to make a political commitment for the next commission.
mr pers@@ son is in danger of mess@@ ing up in true southern italian style if he distribu@@ tes all the responsibilities at gothen@@ burg, maybe giving the food agency to helsinki, to a country which, i would argue, is the least suitable location for it.
so what is the resul@@ t?
such a situation has economic knock-on effects and we are duty bound to bear this in mind.
tomorrow, we will have achieved two milest@@ ones perman@@ ently, or at least, that is what i thought before we heard the statement.
it is precisely for this reason that there are two amendments that we tabled as a group, because, in our view, they are missing in the joint resolution.
in modern organisations it falls to the administration of political power or of legislative power to exercise control.
taxes are, of course, a very national matter and one in which the nations' self-determination is important.
in many states, as little account is taken of victims of offences of negligence as of victims who are unable to prove lasting or grave detri@@ ment.
another important aspect of this measure, aimed at job security for women, is the ban on making them redundant during the period from the start of their pregnancy until at least six months after the end of their maternity leave.
in addition to the universal figures of vas@@ co da gam@@ a and mag@@ ell@@ an, portug@@ al’s notable politicians included pom@@ b@@ al, the lus@@ itan@@ ian ric@@ he@@ li@@ eu.
first of all, legal migr@@ ation: we live in a world of increasing mobility, and well-@@ managed migration is in the interests of all partners.
an individual's rights to belief, to religion, to thought and to conscience are interdepend@@ ent.
this is dictated by the geograph@@ y, and also by the geo@@ politics.
cooperation on scientific and technological research between the european union and jordan is identified as a priority in the euro-mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the european communities and their member states and the ha@@ sh@@ em@@ ite kingdom of jordan, which has been in force since 2002.
i therefore welcome the commitment of the slovenian presidency to conclude this process of transforming the code into a common position during its mandate, although i recall, too, that previous presidencies made the same promise to no avail@@ .
i see the refugee camps - people return@@ ing, not quite knowing where their homes were, people coming back from tanzania and people coming across from kiv@@ u in the congo.
because this instrument is no longer available, the range of economic cards left to play is largely reduced to public spending policy, but the freedom of action of the euro countries is restricted in this area too, because they must fulfil the requirements laid down in the growth and stability pact.
let us not forget, however, that the statistics were also european.
security should not be the sole concern@@ ; we should also be concerned with human@@ ising criminal justice.
i think the commission has submitted a sensible proposal here, on the basis of which we can hold sensible talks over the coming months.
clearly the internet world is going to be highly suitable for the commission to set that up.
nor do we wish to provide money for aid for tobacco cultivation since this directly contributes to public health problems.
however, it is not very easy to accomplish all this as we find ourselves doing away with provisions which obstruct the free movement of goods and at the same time taking steps to guarantee maximum safety.
we look forward to the proposals you intend to present on 10 january for translating these action programmes and green papers into action, because we are convinced that we cannot omit any measure that will help to improve the european union's security of supply.
in general, the principle of tax cooperation must take priority over tax competition, in particular, in the context of the work done by mr monti and the reinvigor@@ ation of the internal market.
it is, therefore, a matter of en@@ suring, above all, that these objectives are attained rather than of imposing new objectives that would be un@@ attainable at present.
i thank the president-in-office for doing a sterling job all day here in parliament.
the who standards are based on b@@ athers and not on can@@ o@@ e@@ ists or sailing crew who accident@@ ally go over@@ board.
when they did not listen, things ended badly.
it takes more to shape europe than a few high-@@ flying speeches by foreign minister@@ s; it means working day in day out on europe as our project for the future.
nonetheless, there is an abiding memory of the best moments of all the meetings held and the hours of work undertaken together.
the committee on legal affairs has considered these four cases over a long period of time and is now in a position to make recommendations to the house.
for these reasons, i am voting in favour of the motion for a resolution.
the position is that the proposal on specified risk material has been postponed by three months, from 1 january to 1 april.
mr president, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after what has been said already, it will be impossible for me to be origin@@ al.
they are successes we would never have thought possible only a few years ago: economic convergence and the participation of a broad group of states in economic and monetary union, the beginning of the accession process for new member states, the first steps in implementing a common employment strategy.
we refuse to clearly condemn the united states for the criminal attitude it is displaying at guantánamo.
however, i still have a number of concerns, first of all about echo.
they have now got to grips with "@@ eu@@ " .
this is only a white paper. in making recommendations, i support mrs schörling in asking the commission to strengthen its environmental commitments, rather than relax them.
then you have something like the equal treatment of women by comparing them only with other women and not with men.
the question of whether turkey is fit for entry to the european union is also relevant.
if we do not implement something which will make countries realise that they there will be harsh consequences if they conduct economically irrational policies, we will not get anywhere.
in 1995, for example, the value of transactions on the international foreign exchange market exceeded usd 13@@ 00 billion per day - more than twice the total currency reserves of the industrialized countries.
now it is time to sa@@ ve.
therefore we should vote overwhelmingly to adopt the proposed committee, which will form the basis for far-sighted legislation.
i believe that we need to reaffirm this point, by doing what my group tried to do and denouncing those parts of the agreement in which morocco absor@@ bs sahrawi territorial waters.
it is quite out of order that we should do anything other than vote on each of the points on the voting list.
on wednesday, 1 april 1998, 51 gra@@ ves in the ag@@ i@@ os ele@@ f@@ ther@@ i@@ os greek orthodox gra@@ vey@@ ard in istanbul were des@@ ec@@ ra@@ ted.
i would state that the prospect of accession to the eu by cyprus offers an opportunity and incentive to seek a political settlement on the cyprus question.
furthermore, setting objectives and practical targets and trying out a more simplified and operational legislative framework that is immediately understandable to all actors involved, will certainly lead to greater awareness and to more effective environmental protection.
yesterday russia resumed gas deliveries to ukraine in relatively small quantities that meet less than one third of the normal flow@@ , but decided to use an entry point which, according to the ukrainian company, is difficult to use, and this led ukraine to stop transport.
each year two million european union residents die as a direct result of these diseases.
the officials from sweden@@ ’s ministry of foreign affairs who have been able to visit me@@ h@@ di gh@@ ez@@ ali are not allowed to tell his family how he is.
yet in these various processes the children involved are not sufficiently listened to and taken seriously.
our agricultural policy has been successful in the past, but it has no place in the future.
i agree with the idea that europe needs to find new momentum.
we try to help those in the west bank, palestinians, as much as we can via financial help and in every other way.
that is what we need for the transport sector, and also in general to increase our competitiveness in the right direction, namely towards safety and improved quality.
despite some uncertainty, the message of the tunisian people is loud and clear: tunisia wants to be a stable democracy that fully respects fundamental rights and freedoms.
one point which we insisted on was investment in public service broadcasting, without which it is impossible to operate to high standards.
this measure has two purpos@@ es: on the one hand, it encourages ren@@ unci@@ ation, as it gives a way into other markets for these facilities and, on the other hand, it promotes a sector such as biofuels at a time when there is so much talk of the need to increase supply.
far from it, in fact.
we want to encourage mr almunia to prompt the commission to put forward a new proposal of 201@@ 8 and we want to amend two points in the report that has been adopted.
we must help, and we want to help, so that a sustainable process of normalisation can take place.
on the cross-border transfer of registered offices, the commission agrees that companies should be free to move their seat within the european union, provided that the rights of shareholders, creditors and employees are guaranteed.
spot checks in the country of origin, physical checks on the borders combined with improved information about the destination country, independently of bse, can show a way to the future here.
the region's strong presence, and the absence of effective local employment legislation, obliges us to ensure that the new agreement lays down robust rules not only of an economic nature but also, above all, as concerns employment, the environment and human rights, thereby limiting the effect of social dumping.
when adopted, i hope that the targets set by the commission will be met and we do not repeat the situation we had with old fri@@ d@@ ges when the directive gathered dust on the shelf until it was too late to implement it in time.
i believe we have the right and the duty to do so.
we need then to strengthen international cooperation and direct action for min@@ e-@@ clearance and also to identify measures to assist the victims of mines.
by the same token, the framework strategy for gender equality encourages an employ@@ abil@@ ity-@@ oriented approach and women’s access to jobs in the new technologies sector.
the terrorists of hamas, for example, will not be eliminated by se@@ aling off the west bank and gaza strip, or by keeping thousands of palestinians in prison - measures which are causing an increase in unemployment, and a deterioration in the living conditions of the people in those territories.
mr president, let me first of all say that i had no objection to postponing my business in order to allow the important debate on violence against women to take place.
i now ask myself if there are still a number of things which we do not suspect of being able to enter the chain but which do, in fact, end up there.
the council has always made it absolutely clear that progress on each of those tracks is inter@@ linked, that we cannot make progress in one area without being able to demonstrate that we are making progress in others.
last month the authorities did, admittedly, intervene in the share markets to prevent speculation - successfully, according to reports i have read - but in my view this was a one-off measure.
i hope that we can be in active contact with the european parliament during the process, because parliament has shown a very keen interest in these issues of climate, which is welcome considering how important this is for our future.

mr president, could i first of all thank the committee on transport and in particular the rapporteur, mr ko@@ ch, for his very useful contribution to the improvement of the commission proposal on the safety adviser examination.
i am also convinced that the commission’s battle with the us in respect of market shares in steel production must be supported.

de mr president, on the subject of the same point of order, it is not enough for the president to take note of this.
the vote will take place tomorrow.
my reply would be that it is a great many specul@@ ators, cas@@ ino players and thi@@ ev@@ es.

this regulation is part of a package of regulations that aims at strengthening mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the member states, in this case in the field of excise duties, in which tobacco smuggling is particularly significant.
it demonstrates european solidarity by reducing regional asymme@@ tries and contributing to economic, social and territorial cohesion.
it will pave the way for a partnership essential to our own security and help us encourage greater regional cooperation, so vital for the stability of central asia.
how can we achieve the best result@@ s?

we are in favour of women being given in this respect, once and for all, the freedom to choose, and of policy@@ makers creating the conditions under which women will be able to do just that, particularly with regard to education, vocational training and equal pay for equal work.
for this, i think that, apart from these areas, we will have to undertake a debate on tomorrow' s europe, its borders and its nature, subjects which i have mentioned many times because i believe that this is a great task that we must perform together.
we should emphasize research to improve the safety of vehicles, their drivers and the roads, and we should emphasize infrastructure, meaning electronic systems, simply to make traffic safer.

the commission’s views on the concentration of the media in europe, and on how it might react to this problem, also need to be ascertain@@ ed.

if we do not seriously evaluate the sustainable and qualitative nature of growth, there is a risk that we will underestimate the efforts which still need to be made in order finally to give the construction of europe a social aspect.

the eu structures have themselves been a guide to us in the negotiations on arrangements for cooperation and joint action within ireland, the north and the south.
the june list observes that, in this situation, it is fortunate that the european parliament does not have powers of codecision regarding the eu's agricultural policy. otherwise, the eu would fall into the trap of protectionism and of heavy subsidies to all the various groups within the agricultural industry.

some want nuclear power stations that are more modern@@ ; others want these closed down for good.
i would, nevertheless, like to take this opportunity to stress a fundamental concep@@ t: the reform is not and never has been a political end in itself, to be taken out of its wide institutional and political context, that is.
the terms of a treaty can be amended if there is the unanimous agreement of the contracting parties.
i am sure that this will not be the last time we debate these issues, and i draw a lot of inspiration from such debates.
for that reason i wish to propose a split vote on the first and second motions in this amendment.
mr president, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a report on the european parliament, and i am astonished first of all not to see one of mrs staun@@ er' s letters appen@@ ded to this document because, as you know, she likes to get involved in our business even though her own activities are concerned with something completely different.
and then perhaps everyone will stop ban@@ dying about arguments which are asking for trouble@@ !
this is why better promotion is required of the exchange of experience and good practice between member states in all areas affected by the beijing platform for action.
this is the key provision to ensure that not only national interest drives regulatory decisions but that european interest is also taken into account.
we will ensure that the language versions are corrected and correspond to one another.
we will certainly relate them faithfully to our colleagues in the council.
of course, these are but small tragedies and are nothing when compared to the important political project that is the european union, but let us consider that when we propose special rights on one group of citizens, we automatically de@@ grade the rights of others.
what can we conclude from this?

i urge the differences between the countries to be brought out more strongly because otherwise we would be doing something to them which we would not like to be done to us.
the european payment order will also apply to individual citizens who work or live in another member state and who can also take advantage of this new law.
another fundamental issue is transparency in bank charges, costs and the real conditions for mortgage loans, in order to protect consumers and investors and ensure access to credit for individuals and small businesses.

for this reason we think that placing arbitrary limits on the free movement of persons within european territory would be a serious step backwards for the european integration that we so much dream of@@ .'

we cannot accept today, within the european union, the most vulnerable having to pay for the adjustment policies.
you cannot imagine not only the lives we shall sa@@ ve, but also the money that the member states will save by applying programmes which address this specific sector, especially heart disease and cancer.
as this will not happen of its own accor@@ d, we need to look into the applications that could strengthen social cohesion.
– madam president, today is not a day for delivering eu@@ lo@@ gies, nor is it a day when we should be saying that the law – european law – has been broken.
clearly, the circumstances of the past year - what with the commission' s departure and the reports by the committee of independent experts - provide a reminder that we need to secure for ourselves a foundation which can give us confidence that resources are being administered in a reasonable way.

all member states and the entire weapons industry in the eu must observe strict controls and transparency provisions.

today, the european dynamic is again under way and we meps shall finally get to address issues as sensitive as the crisis in the dairy sector or even last winter@@ 's gas crisis.

belarus was used to block euron@@ est.
i find this difficult to believe.

the important thing, as far as this subject is concerned, is that we should endeavour to think of all of the aspects, namely - and i put them in al@@ pha@@ be@@ tical order - culture, the economy, the social aspects and technology, as a unity and to treat them equally and not promote one aspect one day and another the next.
the needs of our environment and biodiversity should be paramount in this area.

it is alleged that the purpose of the pipeline is to guarantee german@@ y’s energy supply, but that is only half the story.
madam president, i come with two questions for the commissioner.

although we as yet have no certain proof that the rules for compliance with the kyoto agreement and the mechanisms will turn out to be good rules, it is still completely feasible to establish sound rules in the planned timetable.
for the governments in russia, turkey and israel, it will become easier to op@@ press chech@@ en@@ s, kurds and palestinians when the eu wants to be on good terms with them.

in his excellent report, mr frute@@ au welcomes the progress in relations between the european union and the o@@ cts from an institutional, economic and financial point of view, even though there remain many questions on the commission' s proposals having to respond to the objectives included in declaration 36 with regard to the o@@ cts annexed to the treaty of amsterdam.

in paragraph 5.@@ 4.@@ 1 of its proposal the commission rightly states that moderate alcohol consumption appears to offer some protection against cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease among people over the age of 45, but i believe it is a my@@ th, based on very weak scientific foundations, to say that a little alcohol is good for you.
so we do have a problem.
we all want to significantly reduce the quantities used and the toxicity of the various ingredients in deter@@ gent@@ s.
where are the states@@ men and states@@ women of europe?

the blame here lies with the member states.

mr president, madam commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, virtually five months after the beginning of the provisional application of the fisheries agreement between the european union and morocco, the european parliament is now giving a favourable opinion on this agreement.

everyone thought that the current institutional framework - a centralised monetary policy, a stability and growth pact, and the coordination of the other economic policies - would enable the differences between member states to be overcome, or at least reduced.

let me say something on other subjects raised at the summit.

i want a single market in services, but i will not accept the '@@ country of origin@@ ' principle, which will give us a lower level of social services and will undermine the faith that millions of people outside europe place in us to lead the way in creating a better world.
we are not working at council level here.
written statements rule 142
we can give many good reasons for that.
however, products imported into the eu from third countries very often do not conform to those same high standards.
we are reaching a stage where the european union is faced with potential budgetary gri@@ d@@ loc@@ k.

sixthly, the eritre@@ an police is forcing members of non-@@ registered churches to sign statements in which they renounce their religious convictions.

the role of the national parliaments must be increased, not decre@@ ased.
there again we have already proposed pilot countries involving the largest number of member states.
military might, political persecution and taking away the freedom of people who, in defiance of all repressive measures, continue to fight for democracy - all these must not be tolerated.
as i have said to parliament on many occasions in the past, action towards a smoke-free europe is one of my main priorities.
i believe i have covered most of them in my introductory remarks, but let me stress a few points.
question no 7 by h-04@@ 18@@ /99:
the second proposal states that it should be possible to apply reduced or even zero rates of vat to goods linked to education, social security and culture.
this area should also continue to occupy its rightful and important position within the framework of community assistance provided under the cards 2000-2006 programme, article 2 of which explicitly mentions aid for the return of refugees and displaced persons.

we would particularly like to say that these are crimes for which we should show no complac@@ ency, and that these measures must be applied in cases where the children involved are under 16 years of age, which is what we voted for in committee.
furthermore, it is our view that the necessary fight against terrorism cannot be used as an excuse to bro@@ ach fundamental aspects of the sovereignty of the union's member states.

the wiebeng@@ a report has undoubtedly shown that we need solutions.
as you know, this is a very crucial and decisive time for the whole enlargement process and especially for cyprus.

i think it is fair, balanced and comprehensive.
prove that you are willing to accept political responsibility at this eleventh hour@@ !
there are numerous human rights abuses in burma@@ : forced labour, persecution of dissident@@ s, cons@@ cri@@ ption of child soldiers, etc. we call for aung san suu kyi and all those detained or put under house arrest to be immediately and unconditionally released, along with all other political prisoners, and for the n@@ ld offices closed in may 2003 to be re@@ opened.
what is now crucial is to agree on policy conclusions and, if need be, corrective action on the basis of this assessment.
