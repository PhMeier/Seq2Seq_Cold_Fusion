the council did not take any view, nor should it be, because we have to leave it to the convention to prepare all these things.
that is what this parliament and the commission want.

it was proposed at the end of the day.
this is unacceptable.
honourable members, i am sure that you will monitor the implementation of this effort.

others, especially from the point of view, are critical of the legislation because they cause considerable problems.
but let me also say one thing about the fact that particularly in recent times, i have become aware of the problems that have been well known in the eu and in particular for me.
i think it is totally unacceptable - and i was also in canc√∫n - that we should try to find ways rather than talking about the demonstrators in the place of negotiation.

madam president, ladies and gentlemen, it is a decision by the committee on economic and monetary affairs that you intend to support the committee on economic and monetary affairs and to support this proposal.
the political agreement on the common position includes most of the amendments tabled by parliament on the text of the proposal.
this is a case when it comes to the responsibility of the commission as a cataly@@ st, and even more so, if names are mentioned and arbitrarily made.
the time has come for us to help now.
so we need a solid framework and we must really agree on our procedures and policy.
given the complexity and scope of the external relations of the eu, the scope of dialogue and consultations with third countries could be applied to human rights issues or to the second place.

you all know that we in our countries have the right to information about europe and the european institutions.
however, it is a negative effect on the principle of cofinancing that the cap should be called into question and, in particular, the farmers of the less developed regions.
we point out that there is a need to propose such measures unless they are based on the studies that have been mentioned at the same time giving our concerns and our opposition to the further strengthening of the role of the commission.
there is also a risk not for those who have spoken in the campaign for the last irish referendum campaign.
mr president, we have already had a full agenda today.
mr president, commissioner, with pleasure and great interest i have been able to read your attention over the last few weeks.
the sitting was opened at 9.00 a.m.
i am sorry to see whether i can provide information about the total cost of providing information about the cost.
the role played by the public services and local policies in the area is still in place.
the main reason for this is the growing dependence of the european union's energy sector.
thirdly, there is talk about whether schengen is now the first or the third pillar.
the cooperation proposed by you in the new framework with the acp and the acp is important and is a complement to us.
i think it can be said that our own expectations have also been made.
we are trying to do it.
i would like to thank you as a doctor for the respect you have given to our profession.
three weeks after this floo@@ d, the whole world of the situation is deliberately becoming aware of the situation of thousands of people and the lives of thousands of people who are dying in a referendum, and they will die if we do not get to grips with them in order to get out of the situation in which they find themselves.
they were a prisoner for democracy in europe, the new border of democracy in europe, a democracy, which was difficult at the time, because it was in italy, greece, poland, hungary and germany.
this new responsibility affects all of us whether we are members of parliament or of the commission.
we can achieve 3% economic growth.
however, it also contains a problematic support for those who have spoken against my group so that it would be very difficult to vote in favour of the report.
the measure of tariffs on tariffs is the cost of an efficient and structural effort and this type of agreement which we as a parliament have developed for cross-border and enforced is also a matter for the eu.
let us be honest, ladies and gentlemen, who is looking for new substances to be able to get to grips with new substances.
i have not seen such a short-sighted and complicated proposal.
today, as our regulatory instruments are already today, we still have the reform of this open approach to the framework of the directive, which will allow us to speed up the markets in competition with a view to the general rules of competition.
should we not, therefore, concentrate on a programme in order to monitor turkey on the path to a democratic constitutional state and to continue to do so.
the assertion of the european union that it wants to establish equitable and binding rules for the functioning of the markets and the achievement of profits will prove to be a mere step in the opposite direction.
it is one of the opportunities for the whole world.
in practice, the civilian population is mainly affected by anti-personnel mines.
only a genuine internal market will improve our chances of growth and jobs.
this task cannot be resolved within the narrow framework of the existing nation states.
mr president, there are various aspects of the process of enlargement of the european union, which is also on the agenda.
these shortcomings need to be remedi@@ ed.
but there are very many reports that this house will be presented with a large number of amendments.

3 000 workers are employed in state forests while the private sector only 120 employees.
i have no knowledge of the other areas in the north sea in the north sea but sometimes more than 50% of catches in the sea because these fish are too small or no longer in any way.
as is rightly pointed out in the report, the dependency of the region from russia must be small and small.
i find that regrettable.
something needs to be done about the reform of mr kinnock@@ : we can see that the aid for the consequences of this once again will only be achieved by the end of the next disaster.
ladies and gentlemen, i apologise to mrs ferrero-wald@@ ner.
secondly, we should fully enforce the internal market in pensions.
mr president, i was courageous because i was courageous and because, despite numerous conflicts of conflict, article 13 on gender equality has been proposed and put forward arguments for that rather than for the others.
for years, the court has been waiting for these deficiencies and, at last, to find its comments.
you will then be 65 and i will be doing so.
secondly, there was a lot of money into the coffers of our finance ministers.
a new opportunity for consumers to enjoy their resistance.
i am also concerned that the abolition of the process could be understood as a reminder of the importance of the type we cannot be allowed to.
this needs to be addressed.
i am voting against those objectives in the final analysis, and i shall vote against it.
it is increasing, it is dangerous, and it is not normal for reason.
secondly, we cannot argue in favour and we are in agreement on this issue.
the vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
after years in which there was a positive step in the previous regulation, it would be incomprehensible that it would now have been taken up in the programme to take account of the area of industry.
secondly, it is precisely a question of setting up a very specific target for 20 million.
but it also needs to be negotiated on the obligations of the richer countries to help developing countries to support these economic and social costs of the necessary measures.
we are therefore opposed to this european directive and demand that the ports and those who benefit the whole of society are classified as public services.
with this explanation of vote, i repeat the need to take action which will ensure stability and security in the countries of origin.
the action plan proposed by the commission is to ensure the safe use of the internet.
we respect those priorities for the young.
within the limited capacity, she has done a good and good job.
unfortunately, it seems that it has not been so much more so and not just for the sake of the process but also for a moment.
i can also say that not one amendment has been tabled.
we are looking for very active cooperation in the joint parliamentary assembly, and, as mr cohn-bendit, also points out in this regard, our work is becoming an increasingly important one.
however, as a world leader in the area of product safety, we have to prevent these dangerous products - especially in the case of china - of course.
let us combat unnecessary red tape and respect the principle of subsidiarity, but let us not oppose the european institutions precisely because we want to be closer to our citizens.
at the ministerial meeting - the first in the introduction of the second stage in the introduction of a series of courses in which cooperation between the member states can be strengthened.
will he address this issue in the dialogue with the turkish authorities, so that mayors and those who live peaceful coexistence of all living in turkey are once again being used to make peaceful coexistence of all living in turkey.
the success of the reform depends on the commission's efforts to achieve this.
pt i welcome the initiatives and measures taken at european level in order to combat and combat alzheimer's disease.
it is important that the money should be invested in the member states in the countries concerned, because only in such a way that it can be possible to combat hunger and disease.
the danger of the international criminal court is at risk.
this is the case with the idea that if we were to be involved also those involved in the work they do, that is to be done.
mr president, we in the group of the european parliament were pleased to be pleased with the commission's proposal, but even more about the truly ambitious and courageous report by mrs peij@@ s.
i quite frankly understand the commission.
reach will encourage the sector of the sector, because it is the companies that want to bring about the new and more environmentally friendly chemicals on the market, and because it promotes the treatment of the elderly.
the progress that has been made is not aimed at greater willingness to cooperate but to un resolutions and military pressure.
we hope that india and pakistan with the support of the european parliament are more than the one that they themselves and the rest of the world.
if the media are to inform citizens about the work of the eu, they must concentrate on the real activities and should not be constantly in any case or scand@@ als.
it is now up to the fingerprints of the new york to build and have been set up.
i have said in particular because you have set an incredible amount of work to ensure that we arrive at a good agreement on the european external action service.
the adoption of the report was somewhat difficult, because at a point in the committee we were at the beginning of the series of problems we have had.
i voted against.
a great deal too has been said about the report in an environmentally sound way.
we should not be allowed to open the temptation to open up and i congratulate the presidency on this very clearly.
it is at a time when the commission has pledged to present a commitment during the course of the current year for several sectors in the current year and in particular for the introduction of the fruit and vegetables and i expect this to happen.
the next two years will be decisive for this.
it was true that the regime in burma was now first and was prepared and made a few political prisoners over the last time, but that is not enough.
while we condemn all of this - we have been rewarded by the way in which he has been rewarded and how he has been rewarded for the president of presidents.
i would ask the commission and the council to take the press seriously when negotiations with russia.
this part of the resolution is very important, but unfortunately, the conclusions.
thank you for your presence here today for us to take advantage of over cott@@ on, it is a problem for spain and greece.
there are certainly problems, but we can see the possibility of creating a common currency.
the shadow rapporteur deserves our congratulations.
there are a number of changes in the agenda, in addition to those who have been announced on 12 may.
today's vote has taken a great deal.
on research, on the other hand, we have a strong agenda and appropriate initiatives.
as far as the latter area is concerned, community research programmes have laid down in the council in terms of article 7 of the commission's proposal, pursuant to article 7 of the commission.
i am therefore in favour of amendment no 8, which asks for these victims to be given access to the spread of the disease and to prevent them in the event of a pregnan@@ cy.
es mr president, thank you for your speaking on behalf of our institution, which you condem@@ n.
this is the problem and the great challenge.
i said that you were asking you to give you a dozen and you come up with various individuals and reports from a terrorist stud@@ ent, by five.
this is a great step forward, but it is important for them to be fully committed to this directive.
in my view, access to the rural development of the european union is just as important as the one hand to ensure that this basic service is not available in many rural areas.
on the other hand, we also want to adopt specific objectives and measures to be adopted because only in this way we can exert pressure on the member states.
globalisation and changes are social problems.
but the performance of the european union was not accompanied by a great deal of effort, as compared with a great deal of effort.
the group of independents for a europe of nations is very pleased with the quality of the report and the proposed amendments tabled by our colleague, mr corbet@@ t.
in writing. - i abstained on the vote on the appointment of mr radwan@@ , as a member of the court of auditors.
freedom of expression is the foundation of democracy.
however, i would like to emphasise that the life of all its different forms and complex substances must be respected and the strict treatment of the handling and use of such problematic and complex substances.
with regard to accountability i would like to know whether the commission has clearly failed to explain why this authority has not been able to detect the flight of three international terrorists and to stop interfering in colombia before it was published last month.
that is what the treaty requires of us.
mr president, we have once again presented an annual report on the part of the court of auditors' annual report.
our continent will be women and girls as cattle as animals.
this particular enlargement will have a major impact on it.
it must be sorted out who in the european union will have to pay the cost of additional requirements such as tests and inspections here in the member states.
nevertheless, mr president, the proposal by mr callan@@ a to set up plans for small and medium-sized enterprises should be welcomed.
we would not be able to react today if the commission reacted quickly, openly and decisi@@ vely.
this discussion has triggered a dramatic change in the opinion of many people.
the first is the existence and the particularly active nature of the european offices.
it is simply too high for the temptation to put the temptation for our backs.
these countries have just taken up their national identity from the major red tape of the soviet union, so they want their citizens europeans without their national identity or their own democratic institutions.
this is an example of those who cannot make the common values impossible.
applications for such a way as to lead the way in which they are used are being used in the way in which they are treated.
that is why the member states have recognised the high priority that mr piebalgs has made further progress in this area, as well as the recent introduction of energy efficiency or less involved in it.
now we have to admit that it was not all the s@@ ent.
this will not only reduce the dependence of the dur@@ ation, but also a higher number of people who make up these systems.
mr president, commissioner, i am pleased that we have been able to debate a lot of interesting reports in this house over the last few months and also to have been able to adopt in part in the context of the fact that the internal market is also in the transport and in the future.
however, i do not agree with the deletion of the specific line for this young and so on.
this raises the question of the relationship between the european union and the sustainable development of the european union's fundamental principles, such as european solidarity, equal opportunities, sustainable development or human rights.
last month the commissioner de he would like to take the last month and commissioner de he would like to.
i therefore ask you to give you a little bit of what is currently happening in the public and private sectors.
we have to lose sight of the loss of interest in development aid and the execution under which it is supposed to combat it.
it has been possible to completely eliminate them, but to many of them - even if only - in the wording of the transitional arrangements - in the wording of the transitional arrangements - when i mentioned the deadline for transposition of the directive is four years.
however, the content is really a matter of ensuring that this cooperation is based on specific cultural needs in the broader sense of a broader sense of the needs of the cultural and the range of culture.
mr president, i understand your frustr@@ ation.
first of all, i hope that the monterrey council will become even stronger and that the european union will play a strong role in this.
that is why i propose that 15 % be allocated for the 15 %.
mr president, our group has not signed this resolution for several important reasons.
mr president, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, i believe that the council's proposal for a regulation is a response to a situation that is not only in economic terms but also because of the political and institutional response to a real crisis.
mr president, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a sea of difficulties, some of the island is in the form of a sea of difficulty.

a view to the required controls shows that some member states simply do not fulfil their statutory obligations.
the fact that the european parliament is already taking account of the debate today and the final decision on which we hope will be taken will prove that we can make a major and difficult effort in this direction.
the group of the european liberal, democrat and reform party calls for the inclusion of a commission statement on the refusal of the french government to lift the embargo on british beef.
and you are often making our speeches very hard.
15.
it is precisely because of the lack of such a pact that the problem itself is not mentioned by you and you must be strengthened in this direction.

as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy, i note that my committee and the committee on employment and social affairs are in a number of important points in the same direction.
the system of the eu and it is open, non-@@ discriminatory and based on a voluntary basis.
already american companies are already using the first satellite in the space of the region, which is trying to continue.
we should therefore take time to examine the objectives and effects of a may well be examined because of social cohesion, environmental and democratic cohesion, in a may not be subject to restrictions but on the other way round.
nevertheless, the council has given some positive steps in encouraging a greater number of positive responses for two years, which we in the previous question would be in the previous question.
decisions on numerous details need to be made.
we are sometimes quite different from that when it comes to drugs, but in this case it is very hard.
i hope that projects such as this will not lead to more drugs in europe.
we are fortunate to appreciate that a political framework has been achieved in hong kong, which is de facto the condition for the negotiations in geneva that we have achieved something.
in particular, there are deficits in germany.
all of these are small and small tax havens and exceptions which we are obviously allowing and where eu law does not apply.
in fact, we should do everything we can to promote renewable and alternative energy sources.
the focus should instead be on the international stage.
hu mr president, today there is a growing number of challenges.
the possibility of partial or complete suspension of cooperation in the event of serious violations of human rights is no exception to this type of effort.
because pensioners in this country where they were given their pensions and had benefited from this achievement was only an average of six months and so was the best state in this respect.
in the case of fruit and vegetables in connection with fruit and vegetables, it is possible to increase the level of 60 %.
secondly, in view of the fact that the british government is a labour government and i am a member, but at least i am sorry, i feel obliged as chairman of the committee on fisheries or in any other capacity.
we want the european union to have already opened up the networks - and also the cross-border introduction of a single market without national borders, because we want to have effective rail transport.
the suspension of the customs duties of the joint implementation will allow local and azores in the autonomous regions of madeira and the azores and the azores to import a certain amount of premi@@ um.
it is not as a piece of legislation for the mining or the test, given that the future directive on the implementation of the mining sector will also be affected by the safety of the eu.
the heart of europe is now being proposed in the meantime, and the fate of democracy in the european continent.
mr president, commissioner, i would like to start with a short quote from a letter which i recently received from a company with more than 100 officials, a great deal of concern to us in the debate on the agenda.
the state that represents the legal murder of a pillar of its judiciary is much more criminal than those in which it wants to protect society.

we, the young generation, do not want to go back to a traditional system in which safety only means their own security.

the next item is the report by mr titley, on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs, human rights, common security and defence policy, on the second annual report in accordance with number 8 of the operational provisions of the european union of the european union for assurance.

moreover, the european union's foreign policy is only a specific area, and it must therefore be represented in addition to the qualifications and a wide range of the principle of qualifications and a broad geographical basis.
the different taxation of different types is also a factor in which different taxation is also a factor that is how simple or difficult for the european union.
if double standards are applied here, then the candidate countries will be discriminated against.
i think that we could deal with the question very well in the area and that this does not change in fact - until a good use of the european parliament seems to me.
that is, of course, a crucial point, and it cannot be done.
i have raised this issue in my reply to the question by mr radwan@@ , but these elements should, of course, be taken into account in this context.
mixed reactions
finally, we must bear in mind the impact of the conflict on children and young people.
the proposal is a response to the public concerns that exist at the present time to low levels.
it is better to put in place our national interests where we have a common denomin@@ ator, because we can develop a common denomin@@ ator, the strength of national interests.
the commission is very committed to fulfilling its responsibilities and to respond to a great deal of care.

this will bring about the new framework for the internal market with a stable foundation and a positive impact on freedom of establishment and the establishment of new businesses.
we are voting in favour of a gradual approach to the future that we expect to be consistent with the voices of women who expect us to take decisive action.
in this context, the question arises as to whether the current debate on the arrangements of the eu and the trade unions in the czech republic and the threat associated with the threat of strikes only serves to turn attention to real problems.
my apologies for the very legal nature of that answer.
nothing is said about this.
nl mr president, i would like to extend warm congratulations to mr kinnock but i think that he is very much to congratulate mr kinnock.

this has also been an environmental impact, as there is more and more hone@@ y.
however, when mergers are at a time when the european union is again at the forefront of employment in the context of its consequences for the labour market and regional planning in the context of its consequences.
that is why i believe that it is urgent that we should not allow efforts to be made to enable the people to take part in mobility and to take a clear signal that they have rights to participate in mobility.
an example of this is because it shows that there is no longer any prospect of the balkan countries and that those countries that wish to do so are already able to meet the normal conditions required by the european union.
the second aspect is the obligation to provide a sine qua non for the introduction of energy efficiency.
finally, the different definitions of how to deal with the situation and management of these units should be re@@ opened, because we would avoid different standards to those of the same regions and problems as they could be applied in the way in which they could be applied in the case of the member states.
hence the importance of these measures too.
it is true that in this market we will contribute to greater efficiency in the operation of business, but this can only be done by means of a harmonised regime of public service obligations.
these were of course issues of common interest such as those applied to trade or in the eu.
but this was adopted by the large majority of the house and with the socialists and we ask that it be corrected in their lists.
hydrogen has other characteristics as conventional fuels such as petro@@ l, and the proposal therefore lays down all the necessary safety requirements.
in fact, this attempt to create a disability is based on common harmonised standards, the necessary standards which allow for the market to be the best in operation.
in the white paper on sport, which was adopted on 11 july 2007, issues such as the free movement of persons are also widely addressed in the commission's white paper.
it could play a major role in helping to build up our extensive institutional debate with a view to the council, the commission and the european parliament in the name of the council, the commission and the european parliament.
in conclusion, i would like to mention two other issues.
what is at stake.
the european economy must make the european economy the most competitive and dynamic and not on the basis of the intensive use of resources, which will require greater and greater application of the implementation to our processes and products, but also the existence of other factors.
in my opinion, we must invest in diversity and in technological innovation in response to the current energy challenges and the issues related to it.
written statements rule 149
this is a challenge to which we should give all the assurances that he plans to give a new political impetus in the action plan for justice and home affairs and the programme for dialogue between cultures and civilisations.
many of my colleagues wanted the commission to give up.
the solution must be to ban the sale of sales - not just the ban on re-@@ fur@@ s and the european commission and a number of european countries, but a complete ban on the problem of the execution and lack of control.
this is exactly what we are doing, and the reasons for this are all well known.
that is not what we are talking about.
it is also a case that this resolution was adopted pursuant to rule 1371 of the rules of procedure, which concerns the election of the commission as a whole and not the replacement of a single commissioner.
that was planned from the beginning.
the debate is closed.
we can see what we have achieved in our part of europe because we have not succeeded in bringing about a transport policy in the right direction.
in the united states, it was not the same tough monetary policy as in europe.
tomorrow, we will also be looking forward to a great deal of progress in the field of energy policy, which we have conducted numerous technical meetings in the last few months and all aspects relating to energy policy in the field of energy cooperation have made considerable progress.
, rapporteur. - el mr president, as the house knows, my report deals with the spanish initiative aimed at simplifying and reducing bureaucracy and reducing red tape by allowing seafarers at the external borders of the member states so that the member states have made redundant.
it is because of the increasing number of people who become more involved.
the second condition is that you should have the courage to inform the governments of the public about the decisions that have been made about the future of europe, and that they must seek their support.
we must not let ourselves be clear: we give money that we are giving direct to us money.
these are such massive changes which need to be made much more widely in relation to security and to a great deal more attention because it has far-reaching consequences.
what i am mainly concerned about is the taking into account the specific geographical case, in particular what it does not surprise you.
the laws must be clear and far-reaching and must be applied by all member states and properly enforced.
it is up to us to build up a situation without obstacles and not only hurdles and then solemnly remove them.
we are not talking here about the cancellation of a staff of the representation of the government, which is the presidency of the council.
mr president, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this respect, we were of the opinion that there was no major studies on the impact of any more than sufficient information to prepare this proposal.
i would like to thank him sincerely for his contribution to this framework programme, which is based on his ideas on the european research area, as well as for the new instruments, such as integrated planning.
public investment and public expenditure in the direction of the introduction of a few moments ago, which you have just described is the spirit of this stud@@ ent, which you have just described as you pointed out.
as far as the future is concerned, the commission estimates that its action as an investment in responsible fishing must be considered and not just a simple one.
then there is the question of the euro.
we also need to think of the european council resolution which has already proposed a plan for cooperation in the field of the area in june.

that concludes the vote.
i believe that the proposal is therefore to be welcomed as a whole, but we must look at it in the context of the green paper that we are debating here in this house and which will cover the problem of supplementary pension schemes.
this means that it was considered to be a step in the disappearance of the disappearance of a sector which would inevitably lead to the unemployment of millions of workers, and this scenario was agreed at the time when the european union was in the fight against unemployment.
i was disappointed by the commission's proposals, which really had its borders, and i hope that parliament's proposals will be taken up and that the commission will also submit proposals in connection with the effort.
i object to the fact that the eu is more and more involved in national efforts and corruption.
in this connection, the report is based on the fact that information is currently available on the need to comply with data on information provided by international agencies in the fisheries sector.

illegal immigrants in particular are a problem here because they cannot be regulated and controlled by barely regulated and controlled.

the proposals for changing the amount required from 29 to 32 posts and also to the horizontal increase in the required signatures of 29 to 32 do not help to weaken those small groups whose importance is more than clear in the recent times.
mr president, the barcelona process is the support of the southern mediterranean in its development and independence.
we need a reinforcement of dialogue with it.
why will the netherlands be given some eur 1 000 for every dismiss@@ al, eur 1 000 and denmark will receive eur 1 000.
i know that is the third pillar, but it is a question of political life.
i cannot see that in the text.

author. - madam president, i put the eu in 2005.
when i was a man in which i took the floor, i would like to make a different starting point.
but in my view it cannot and should not be allowed to interfere with the internal political parties, otherwise there is a risk that democracy will itself be sacrificed in this respect.
the bse crisis should be a lesson to us.
i am in a position to try and understand that.

at present, mr president, mr winkler, president of the czech republic, the only person who decided to oppose this type of lisbon was trying to oppose it.
es madam president, i believe that the day we have heard a great deal of good today has been the alliance of civilisations and the charter of fundamental rights, which was supported by president and the kofi ann@@ an.
it is therefore not surprising that many people who are persecuted in other countries are threatened or are seeking refuge here.
the next item is question time.
my last point is that our troops now turn thanks to aid from russia and other countries.
so, then, the european community and the member state of the european union must realise that the current system does not bring benefits.
the aim of the agreement is to cooperate with the safeguarding of a holistic protection of the development of a holistic protection and sustainable development, including the development of an integrated approach to the situation.
if in any case, i believe that it is always the case that the people should decide on the one hand, and that is the choice.
mr president, commissioner, i think it is good that the council has its own reform.
this time, it is only natural that certain regions in greece have been affected, and it is only natural that we call on the commission and the european parliament to express their support with the people concerned, and here too, the problem.
i naturally voted in favour of the proposal.
it is a very thorough study which has been carried out in the wake of serious research, and i am grateful to you for that.

i congratulate the portuguese presidency on the way in which he chaired the conciliation process, but i hope that parliament will manage to secure improvements in this respect.

i can only share your view.
the aim of the programme was to distribute those who had previously lost several years earlier.

for the first time, you have a legal basis for the fact that someone who receives a salary is given the first step in the right direction.
however, i would like to emphasise another value that i regard as the absolute core of this initiative, which we all support and which we have helped to achieve - that is, the political gain from this initiative.

that is already in itself.
while a number of member states such as denmark undertook with binding targets, other member states will have to start almost from scratch.

if you do not read or read your officials, it will be a step in the right direction.
some believe that this plan could not serve as a model but one could be tempted as it could not be possible to create a workable system for the protection of minorities.
this state of affairs can be changed with commitments on equal opportunities and equal opportunities.
i would also like to mention the introduction of the legislation in this connection.
i am sure that we agree that, as requested in the resolution, the french government has promised the compensation figures and that it must cover all kinds of damage.
if so, i should like to sit back and wait for something to be done.
furthermore, the internet is constantly trying to restore the possibility of large-scale fraud at the expense of patients, too.
together, we have provided help with those who had hope to suffer from humanitarian disasters, more than i could mention from the western balkans to the congo and to our current work in a situation in which we in the western balkans are in vain.
many small and medium-sized enterprises have previously taken advantage of them, they would have too little access to capital and the programmes of the european union.
to the advantage of high incomes and large enterprises are now going to take a positive and public expenditure in a very negative way.
there is no doubt that a problem we must face to deal with the understandable decision by the commission yesterday by the court of ecofin following the decision of the ecofin council.
it is only today that we have to follow specific legislation in a field that has naturally followed specific legislation.
madam president, i very much welcome the fact that we are dealing with the situation in the context because it is a very serious situation.
if the responsibilities of the member states are to understand and show solidarity at the beginning of the term, not - as the european parliament has requested - individual commissioners can be voted on individual commissioners, so the responsibility lies with the commission as a whole.
in fact, these amendments represent a negotiating mandate of parliament with the council at the next stage in the event of a decision which the commission will set on 29 october.
it is important that we take these risks into account and which are based on clear rules, and that is why it is so important to regulate the recognition and authorisation of the european union as a whole.
i hope that both parliament and the council support this initiative and i would like to thank the young union for the efforts it has taken forward.
the council has been officially informed by the turkish government on the grounds for this postponement and the final date for the introduction of the new and if so, what will it be done by the turkish government.

some of the recommendation would therefore have preferred others to be made redundant.
we should be realistic when discussing the content of the treaty and its advantages and disadvantages.
that is why my group is going to support part of the amendments tabled by the group of the greens/european free alliance.
in principle, all the political groups are agreed but our amendment is something that concerns the financial implications.
for years there has been insufficient involvement in developing countries in the field and the training of medical care.
we agree with that.
it is time for the european commission to reduce the expensive administrative procedures because they are not in the long term because they are not in the long run.
i therefore call on the commission to pay particular attention to the fact that there is a real consensus between the various policies and particularly within the selected areas.
the situation is constantly changing and the risks are very great.
it would hardly be anyone else who came to a dossier that was simply a dossier that was not familiar with its content and which would simply give a full response to it.

it would be such a step in the direction of the introduction of the blood and thus his death.
madam president, ladies and gentlemen, i believe that there are undoubtedly some interesting elements and some important opportunities for us in this regard as regards new forms of innovation.
the better harmonisation of the proposed measures proposed by the european commission and by the rapporteur is therefore a good example of all european businesses, since this would make it easier to make it easier for all european companies to be able to be reduced.
it was not able to adopt a draft budget and in parliament to adopt a draft budget for two months in the european parliament for a period of two months for a long time that was not able to adopt a draft budget and in parliament.

secondly, i would appeal to romania and bulgaria, to allow romania to join us in the autumn to wait until the end of the autumn.
in this respect, it is not possible to identify and unacceptable inaction on the part of the commission.

this exemption applies to all the files including ordinary citizens and those who travel for a variety of reasons.

today, we can be proud of all this, and tomorrow we will hopefully be proud of this and we will have every reason to be proud of what we do.
in category 3 there is a mistake in the vote on the committee on budgets, which was adopted by a very narrow majority in the committee on budgets - if it cannot be corrected.
in order for clarity to everyone is to conduct the private lives, it is not a question of making a statement.
but this is not the table@@ : it is a programme for the member states.
make a summit with the americans.
finally, i would like to urge parliament to seek a broad consensus on the adoption of amendment no 37 on the conditions for access to employment.
we have always fought against the artificial divisions in the wake of the struggle and we fought for europe back on both sides.
that is why it is a president of the president-in-office of the council to say that you are just as president of the commission here that we are united and strong as europeans, that we want to live in friendship and partnership with all our neighbours, on the basis of human rights, democracy, freedom, social and above all.
the sixth point is that we have been maintained, but we have not managed to put a stop to it.
as far as drug trafficking is concerned, we should have a very serious introduction, for their efforts and their cooperation.

we agree that measures to improve the daily lives of children and their access to education, information and culture.
what are the ones who do not only intervene in the event of intervention or merely proposals for solutions to a difficult situation.
from my own experience i know that the opposite is the case.
a very specific problem will be resolved tomorrow, because the council will then adopt the directive on the audiovisual european parliament's amendments at its meeting of the directive on the audiovisual sector.
i would also like to ask three more questions on the one hand to the decision on cooperation in order to strengthen poverty by institutional strengthening and other instruments.
it sounds like a good principle, but on which basis the burden is shared by the burden.
i would like to draw up those member states which are aware of this danger in the deployment and processing of the method of the deployment of the member states, which are to be aware of the danger and to review the legal framework so as to allow the possibility of carrying out the possibility of carrying out an external effort.
a stronger emphasis on the operational efforts of the member states at the level of the level playing field is a stronger emphasis on the operational effort.
i think that we would like to see the parents would almost be able to invest much in the protection of their own children.
many of us believe that the aim of reducing poverty is a step towards the streamlining of public finances.
it is the question of what is more sensible in what cases in what cases are to be made more concrete.
however, we should not be over-@@ optimistic about this.
however, genuine integration requires efforts on both sides.
it is very much to be welcomed, because if we do not do this and the citizens do not participate in our programme, because if we do not do so, we will have the survival of this community at stake.
this is why i hope that this regulation will send the first strong signal of the european parliament to an increasingly stringent approach in the field of safety on the streets of europe, a signal that shows that europe is taking place and taking account of the concerns of its citizens.
we believe that these objectives are broadly supported by the present resolution.
in this case, our words as weapons and supporting those people in iran who are fighting for genuine freedom - are an objective which they hope to achieve.
article 25@@ 6 provides for the commission to establish whether a third country has an appropriate level of protection for the transfer of personal data from the european union.
it will not be a subject tabo@@ o.
furthermore, during this part-session, we have better information from the european network on the one hand in the field of the european network.
but the crucial point in our resolutions is that we now believe that we have the opportunity to start new negotiations on the future of tibetans and on a step towards self-@@ government.
after the current events, it would be time to introduce a bottom-up approach.
i would like to ask the commissioner to comment on official statements that indicate that russia will be able to fulfil its energy resources to asia if members of the european union do not meet certain conditions.
in its interim report for the spring european council, the commission has set out a number of directions for the future internal market.
i feel that it would be a black@@ list, and these companies should be on a blacklist list.
the socialist group will join the african colleagues in a fundamental debate on this subject at the next joint assembly.
for the northern dimension to perform their tasks needs a stable financial foundation.
in addition, the public know that this budget does not cover the costs of the implementation of the treaty of lisbon, which is through a back door.
it is obvious that the eu strategy for reform of the un is largely more concerned with respect for european global interests.
i want to make three brief points.
the current legislation on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter dates from 1993 and is definitely not in line with the latest developments in the field of animal health and the eu.
the decentralized authorities assume that these terrible crimes cause the disappearance of many people, including children.
madam president, ladies and gentlemen, i cannot really do anything else to thank the house for its broad support for this proposal from all sides of the house.
i repeat my conviction that the inclusion of the european development fund in the budget will allow greater efficiency, democratic control, participation and development policy, as is the case in other policy areas.
parliamentary investigations are necessary, in particular in countries such as my own country, ireland, for which has been demonstrated that 50 000 and irish airports have been spent on egypt, including in an irish airport.
i have my doubts.
does the commission believe that there are good reasons for doing so.
so let me repeat that we should only ask ourselves politically, which we can actually implement in practice.
these problems have already been mentioned and relate mainly to the division of responsibilities between local and national authorities and the authorities at european level.
israel, this wonderful country, israel, which has a response to the history of human history, israel has the right to express our complete solidarity with israel.
we have a political and moral responsibility, but you also stressed that we are facing a political and moral responsibility, especially as regards human rights and freedom of expression.
mr president, i have already responded to you earlier and i stand by it.
there is no doubt that it is necessary for trade and for trade and geographical indications for agricultural products, to be implemented and to promote the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises.
it does not stop there.
however, we must point out that it must be ensured that interventions in the very dangerous and complex situations such as those that are often taken place in the area of the area of corruption, in order to achieve a substantial increase in the effectiveness of the measures will lead to synergy
realistically, it is probably the best solution that has been achieved.
this parliament too has been a great success for bse and for fraud with cigarettes.
let us now create a market for this one.
there will be no progress on issues such as flexicurity and reform, as long as we do not find a solution to problems such as the security of workers in this area.
an analysis of state aid must always be based on a clear idea of the differences between revenue and costs on the one hand, and the public finances, on the other, that is to say that the presence of the european union is based on the presence of the external effort.
this measure is therefore justified because it cannot be possible to use the budget for projects with the participation of and candidate countries and by making a simplification ‚Äì contrary to what was meant by the introduction ‚Äì the eur 42 million.
madam president, the resolution deals with the problem of the risks involved in taking up the risks of taking into account the difficulty of taking into account the fact that we are easy to build oil.
like the commission, the current political situation in haiti and the impact that this situation has so far is based on the reconstruction of the country.
the rapporteur therefore calls for a new solution to tackle the problem with novel solutions, for example using the possibilities offered by the eu.
however, we must also expect other reciprocity from others.
the forthcoming intergovernmental conference will provide opportunities for further strengthening of the union's transparency and this process has already been launched with the rules governing the accessibility of documents.
mr corbett will of course have the right to answer, but i am not in a position to respond to mrs frassoni on the red card.
it is therefore important that the eu should continue to be able to maintain access to these resources, which allows them to continue to have access to these resources, and to keep them in mind by offering them access to a transposition period.
for these important reasons, i am also in favour of agriculture being preserved in the regions of the countryside.
overall, i believe that the competitiveness of our continent is important for the competitiveness of our continent of energy and that it is important to have a strong energy supply, and i hope that commissioner piebalgs will be able to meet the next opening of an important pipeline and how important it is for europe.
i am sorry to mention something that has been forgotten.
the biggest and most important of all was the summit that was held.
my group strongly concerns a serious concern about this now.
this also means that it is becoming more and more remote from these problems.
that is why reform in 2002 should not only serve to serve as an excuse for us in our own dealings with our own and with our own problems in the world.
this united front aims not just to stop bulgaria and to stop efforts towards a more equitable society but also our country in the eyes of our european partners.
madam president, the members of parliament will recall the president of my question yesterday to the president he said that the bureau alone will review the rule whereby the roll-call votes in parliament will have at least 50 % of all the members of parliament and take decisions.

‚Äì mr president, ladies and gentlemen, despite recognition of the good intentions, we deplore the fact that europe is not up to the tragic events in the context of the international crisis, to deal with the problem of terrorism and the situation in iraq.
as long as these criminal activities do not finally stop and different parts of it, there is little hope for ordinary citizens that their human rights can be defended.
thirdly, we urgently need diversification of the economic possibilities in the field of action.
mr president, minister, it is a big mistake if you want to make a big internal market and economic considerations in europe without barriers.
as a member of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection, i am particularly pleased that it has been included in the compromise proposal.
are there any objections to mr corbet@@ t's request.
all those who believe that the european super-@@ state, all those who believe that people who believe that they should have a right to their own future, must show their support today and help him to step up the pressure he is at present in the near future.

in this context, the report by mr deprez raises several failings and a number of real problems with regard to the deployment of the execution of the m@@ ess.
there was a crucial question, however, at the time, namely the question of financing.
i am referring in particular to the necessary fight against illegal immigration and the eu.
around ecu 1 billion is spent every year in the eu and smoking causes smoking and human suffering.
i am a great many letters from ukrainian people who really are going to be talking about and helping them.
all this will have a serious impact on european union planning.
the directive has managed to strike a balance between guaranteeing good quality and the recognition of the need for a decentralised basis.

finally, i must stress that it is my particular concern to ensure that the victims of terrorism are given due attention and are not only in my country in spain, which is a threat to democratic coexistence and freedom.
in order for products to be classified within the framework of regional level, it is necessary to note that the country of the region is located in the region of regional planning.

a recent example of professor abbas has shown that the abolition of restrictions on alcohol consumption in sweden does not take place.
they are at the end of their day and are technical ones.
therefore, there is no doubt that as proposed in this commission regulation for a council regulation will provide the instruments for supporting the outermost regions.
furthermore, the transitional period is to prevent a separate development of the networks.
the promotion of civil society is the key to developing the human dimension of partnership.
the commission also addresses the humanitarian aid instrument by echo.
i believe that this will be a way of giving impetus to the internal market, and i hope that those regions which have a large number of products and economically dependent on a small number of products, such as the outermost regions have new boo@@ st.

on behalf of the ppe group. - mr president, on behalf of the group of the european people's party, i would like to add the following oral amendment to paragraph 10 in paragraph 10, the words that the decision of the authorities should be replaced by the words of the authorities.
in reality, however, not only are values.
i hope that it will be possible to take action.
as mr graefe zu baringdorf, who spoke earlier, i would certainly confirm my memory that we would be required to investigate a whole series of specific precautions needed to be considered safe before british beef.
madam president, russia has taken a step and some observers speak from a new one.
mr president, the constitutional treaty is long live in the treaty.
sooner rather than later, the european commission - despite its directorate-general for budget - is too much in line with all these outstanding financial instruments with the introduction and the fingerprints of which are so many priorities with funding.
my second point concerns the position of the european union.
i am in favour of taking the floor here and others who are in prison.
much more needs to be done to address the rise of unemployment and poverty, and i abstained in the vote to express my deep dissatisfaction on this point.
on the other hand, europe receives access to research and promotion.
mr president, i believe that the proposal for a good example of cooperation between the different political groups in the european parliament and between parliament and the council and the commission in the various political groups is a good example of this.
ladies and gentlemen, i would like to express my agreement with the excellent report and the comments that it contains.

in particular, the responsibility of the egyptian security forces must be pointed out in the strongest terms.
fourthly, the call for the member states to confirm quickly and confirm both politicians and suppor@@ ters.
in 2002 the parliament said that it was a crime against us.
perhaps the role of smes in terms of employment, the need for access to the bureaucratic and administrative environment and the better coordination of the various programmes of the commission, which is of interest to small and medium-sized enterprises, should be given greater priority.
with the euro, europe has gained international significance.
it is also a question of other issues, ladies and gentlemen, which has been accepted by the council at first reading by the council and the commission.
several of us here have a lot to do with the other.
in 2011, the aid must focus on complex challenges, in particular the efforts to cover the area in the municipalities and the stabilisation of the situation.

ro the european union is currently experiencing economic, financial and social crisis.

mr president, as many of my fellow members have pointed out, this is an extremely important debate and one that is not only discussed here in the chamber of the european union, but in a framework as much as possible.
