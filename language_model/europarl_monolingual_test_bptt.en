the commission accepted this method and, following a very hard negotiation and almost a year’s work, this is what we are presenting to the house today for its approval. </s>

a european parliament document on this subject already exists, addressing what parliament expects from future talks on the mutual protection of foreign investments. </s>
what i am specifically interested in is what is being done in the border regions to sort out the great deal of prostitution that is going on there. </s>
mr president, i welcome the opportunity for debate on this report, on what is an important issue for all our countries. </s>
just compare the work done by europol, which is responsible specifically for detection work in these areas. </s>
in addition, we have focused all our attention on the issue of cofinancing agricultural subsidies and we have forgotten many other issues which we could have tackled and which, unfortunately, have gone by the board. </s>
we also ask that the body of enz@@ o bal@@ don@@ i be returned and, in this respect, we ask for his family to be shown pity as well. </s>
lastly, i would like to remind the ultra-@@ liberals that not only is development aid compatible with free trade, but that it requires it, except when free trade is understood to be solely based upon cynical and even cruel inequalities. </s>
mr president, commissioner, i have very little time but i would like to use it to emphasise the fact that even the commission itself claims that smes are not as well informed about the consequences of the euro as larger firms are. </s>

thus we must be all the more careful with the funds, particularly in view of the crisis weighing on people's minds. </s>
secondly, the elections must also include the several million burmese who, afraid of torture and death, have fled to thailand, bangladesh or india. </s>
i consider this report to be lacking in balance. </s>
i am certain that the youth in action programme will provide opportunities for you@@ ths in many countries to understand and get to know one another better, which will create a strong foundation for taking action against all forms of discrimination and will raise the tolerance levels of young people. </s>
dividing water into two types - one which we can pollute and poison and use as a vehicle for carrying away our rubb@@ ish, and one which we need for our vital requirements - is just not a viable long-term pro@@ position. </s>
the centre must become significantly better in this area than it is at present. </s>
as someone who focuses on agricultural and rural issues, i heartily welcome this initiative. </s>
at the moment, we are pointing our fingers at germany, but perhaps it will soon be our own member states we are pointing at. </s>

in conclusion, i believe that it is vital to make clear to the commission that not only a high degree of flexibility and focus, but also care and attention are required to avoid duplication between the various programmes. </s>
nobody was against it. </s>
new ways of exploiting the financial instrument should be mapped out for countries where the work of ngos is illegal. </s>
i should like to draw attention to the fact that these extra costs which the commission wishes to compensate are not only relevant to the present moment but are structural in nature. </s>
i do not think that it is enough to combat child pornograph@@ y: it is necessary to combat pornography in general, also in order to protect children, and, as has in fact been emphasiz@@ ed, the responsibility for this lies with all adults, in the he@@ don@@ istic climate which now prevail@@ s, where pleasure and money are the ultimate criteria of value and behaviour. </s>
it merely mentions the prosperity, solidarity, security and external influence headings, the content of which remains arbitr@@ ary. </s>
to achieve this, as the rapporteur has explained, it is essential to develop independent official inspections and also to increase the responsibility of operators in the sector. </s>
i welcome the decision to allow greece full participation within the single currency. </s>
the question of young people acquires even greater significance in the context of the current situation - the economic crisis and demographic factors in europe. </s>
this creation of value must benefit not only the enterprises where this is developed, but also the whole business fabric@@ , both upstream and down@@ stream. </s>

in this parliament these events cannot be repeated. </s>
we are now more worried about the apple of germany's eye, football, than about what is really at stake today. </s>
the commission has its political responsibility, and should not be required to surrender it; indeed, in this specific instance, it has no intention of really doing so. </s>
the chairman of the committee on fisheries has a proposal that would secure more money for investigating the effects of the measures already in place. </s>
we really cannot present that kind of proposal to the public. </s>
i also believe that the aspect regarding the fisheries commissioner, with everything that that entails subsequently within parliament, is crucial to ensuring that the problem is solved and that this report becomes an important future perspective. </s>
pl i would like to thank fellow members for drawing up this resolution and for its adoption by the european parliament. </s>
this all calls for renewed and greater effort, not only by the member states, but also by the union as a whole. </s>
that was why the commission thought it better to wait for the constitutional treaty to be ratified before we did anything further. </s>

the framework for the introduction of the euro does not provide for a transfer of sovereignty from the nation states to democratic european institutions - which would be a positive move - but for a true abandonment of the people's sovereignty. </s>
of course we would have an unsatisfactory budget procedure, i would say, mr wynn, because once you have actually agreed in principle to have an au@@ st@@ ere budget, there is very little to discuss because we are all going to be within a similar margin for manoeuvre - both parliament and the council. </s>
this report and the agreement that it rati@@ fies are a symbol of this europe's en@@ sla@@ vement by american imperi@@ alism. </s>

i have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 372 of the rules of procedure. </s>
parliament's recent report on the implementation of the nitrates directive was a very good demonstration of this problem. </s>
it might simply be the case that everybody would put forward more amendments in order to cover all the possibilities that might arise in the course of a debate. </s>
however, i must point out that sanction measures against intellectual property infringements must comply with the principle of proportionality and balance between the gravity of the acts committed and the sanctions applied. </s>
we therefore believe that this form of positive list will survive. </s>
it has become necessary to grant access to this fund to workers in the netherlands that have suffered redundancies in the electronics sector. </s>
the proposed directive would force too many member states with alread@@ y-@@ effective domestic measures to dismantle them, as they would be incompatible with the directive. </s>

it is also a strategic requirement, and you must be at the forefront taking the necessary initiatives. </s>
i agree with mr marin@@ escu@@ , who referred to the commission's communication, and it is indeed more than anyone would have thought even half a year ago. </s>
this right can best be exercised through the use of the petition to the european parliament - a right that is recognised as a basic right in the treaty. </s>

it is important that this summit should achieve concrete results so that the relaunch of dialogue, achieved during president bush@@ ’s visit, can become a reality. </s>

de mr president, ladies and gentlemen, as a journalist, i would like to draw attention to a change in this directive that is of great concern to me personally. </s>
employees in the new member states have the same legitimate claims upon social entitlements and influence as we do. </s>
later, the process very much relates to, and is based on, the national legislation and euratom legislation. </s>
on the other hand, however, the long-term preservation of european production should not be sacrificed to apparent short-term consumer interests. </s>

they have the right to make a qualified choice, and this has been achieved to some extent through the conciliation text - but not to such an extent, unfortunately, that we can now talk about a responsible consumer policy. </s>
here it is your responsibility and that of the commission to make it clear that this perception is in@@ correct, and this is not the way in which the situation ought to be vie@@ wed. </s>
the european council showed that it was able to draw the consequences of the fight that lies ahead. </s>
in tan@@ de@@ m, the report recognises that member states have the sovereign right to opt for or against nuclear power and forcefully asserts that their choice must be respected. </s>
of course, this also means, and this is borne out by afghanistan's history, that we should work together with its own government and respect its decisions, and that it is not our task to involve ourselves in the details. </s>
first, i will take greece as an example, where the situation in the aege@@ an, turkish aggression, the stoc@@ king of stupid and dangerous weapons, adversely affect the development and growth of certain regions, especially the aegean islands. </s>
no commitments concerning this sector will be given on this occasion. </s>

i must, however, register my disappointment at the treatment of the outermost regions, and in particular madeira and the canary islands. </s>

i think that this effort must focus on two points: </s>
we have to get the balance right between ambition and realism when it comes to the matters before us. </s>
gradually and progres@@ sively. </s>
to accept such a thing is in effect to exclude oneself from eligibility for european party funding. </s>

kare@@ lia has a communist government in the autonomous kare@@ lian republic. </s>
our group believes in solidarity. </s>
i have to say that although the commission appears to be supporting parliament up to a point, it is playing the role of the wise teacher at the last minute and trying to get the council's position approved. </s>
what we are talking about is the shared interest in ensuring an alternative source of gas. </s>
the difficulties we face in devising a programme of this nature are substanti@@ al: the coll@@ ation of data, for example, the characteristics of which vary from one state to another@@ ; and there are instances in which some national data is, moreover, impossible to track down. </s>
de madam president, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about disturbances in air traffic and also its economic impact on aviation. </s>
it is a case of the eu having to follow its own rules. </s>

mr president, i am convinced that our starting point should be one of confidence. </s>
what are we doing to protect them? </s>
it provides for a more balanced trade and development approach and is intended to support a number of the compromises proposed by the rapporteur. </s>
after all, a payment system is a network, and a network develops at the rate of the slow@@ est members that belong to it. </s>
but only a major crisis or a grand historic compromise can bring this about. </s>
it is reported from the regions that these in turn were seen there as merely pet@@ ty. </s>
people have died, and many are still under the threat of what might happen to their health. </s>
at the same time, in order to send a strong signal to the burmese regime that we do not agree with its policies, the european union has decided to strengthen the targeted measures against the burmese regime if it has not fulfilled the t@@ ul@@ lam@@ ore conditions by the time of the asem summit. </s>

no, it is obvious for us in@@ sid@@ ers that it means equivalence with the council. </s>
i would like to ask the commission quite openly what it intends doing to bring this about. </s>
this does not add up. </s>
only negotiations on a two-state solution will bring that security, and i would appeal to all concerned to start those as soon as possible. </s>
if there were a european strategy in this area, it would allow a more integrated approach and a more effective response to treatment and awareness of mental illness@@ es, making the european public more sensitive to brain patho@@ logies associated with ageing. </s>
it is my firm belief that the free movement of workers is one of the major driving forces behind the european union’s economic growth, by which i also mean job creation. </s>
that could happen straight away. </s>
i, of course, welcome the mobilisation of the solidarity fund to aid the victims of the tragedy that struck madeira following ab@@ normal rainf@@ all. </s>

we must not forget that the schengen agreements, imperfect though they are, have enabled the citizens of the signatory states to understand the true meaning of the freedom of movement required by the treaty, still a dead letter but living in the spirit of schengen. </s>
the current status quo of a 12@@ -@@ mile limit for the area is the best possible compromise for the whole of the french fishing sector. </s>

i don't think so@@ ! </s>
the report's appeal for an increase in commission staff assigned to management of the meda programme is one we wholly support. </s>
it is recognised rather clearly and in good terms that the principle of subsidiarity is iter@@ ative and applies down the line, not just between the union of the member states, but to the regions and local authorities as well. </s>
it must be considered, however, that this position of the rapporteur does not simply mean accepting the status quo, which, furthermore, he feels is unsustainable. </s>
it is an important point that, as an alternative, the north european pipeline could be built over@@ land through european union countries. </s>
people are under the illusion that they can buy a holiday home cheaply for the exact period they want to take their holidays. </s>

on the one hand we have a political and, indeed, a moral obligation to honour the treaty by admitting new members in accordance with it. </s>
it is fairly certain that one of these countries, and possibly both, will make use of this opportunity. </s>
that gap is very large, which is why mrs merkel has spoken of a competitiveness pact. </s>
what this does, in fact, is pull together all the various stran@@ ds. </s>
i speak as parliament's rapporteur on the 1996 annual economic report and on the broad economic guidelines. </s>
but, given that there is this interim problem and given that enormous difficulties are being caused at the moment, are there no measures at all that the commission can introduce so that the procedure is made much more straightforward and efficient, albeit in the inter@@ im@@ ? </s>
it is also essential that the calculation method be precise and harmonised throughout the eu. </s>
the events of the last few months, which led the european parliament to refuse discharge for the 1996 financial year, widely demonstrated a general lack of rigour in the management and monitoring of a number of community initiatives and programmes. </s>
i have said several times before that i was born in 195@@ 7, the year of europe, and elected to parliament a year after we came into europe. </s>

in the last 150 years, they have been systematically bought up and forced out of business by large newcom@@ ers. </s>
counterfeiting, piracy and infringements of intellectual property in general are part of an increasing phenomenon today, one that has taken on an international dimension and represents a serious threat to states and to national economies. </s>
his actions clearly demonstrated the european union' s firm position in relation to racism and xenophobic attitudes. </s>
the european union confirmed its constructive position with regard to the goldstone report when, in the debate of the united nations security council on 27 january, just one month ago, it highlighted the importance of conducting adequate and credible investigations into the possible violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. </s>
i have received six draft resolutions submitted under rule 10@@ 8@@ 5. </s>
the commission had announced that it would present a new proposal on the gradual and controlled liberalisation of the postal services before the end of 1998, but nothing came of it. </s>
this is true of such issues as access to medic@@ ation, but also of special and differential treatment, the issues surrounding implementation, and of reform of the regulations on dispute settlement. </s>
in this year's regular reports the commission has again looked beyond the letter of the law and analysed the way democracy functions in practice. </s>

there is also the introduction of criteria relating to food safety, which would raise the issue of the danger of fisheries products caught in the wild not being fit for human consumption. </s>
since newcomers are refused shel@@ ter, schooling and an income, criminal activity represents these people’s only means of survival. </s>
i am of the opinion that the effects of using an area which has not been left in its natural state should be included. </s>
having set the record strain@@ t on these points, i will now turn to the proposals made in the bösch report. </s>
madam president, ladies and gentlemen, this report concerns the euro-mediterranean policy which fully illustrates the ultimate wish to communit@@ ari@@ ze all fields of external policy. </s>
the council has no view. nor should it have, either, for we have left it to the convention to prepare all these things. </s>

that is unacceptable. </s>
i am sure, ladies and gentlemen, that you too, as members of the european parliament, in your work at grassroots level, will note the way in which the code of conduct has been implemented. </s>
democracy is transparency, public accessibility, rule by the people, and participation. </s>

a great deal has already been said about this. </s>

it is a well-@@ drafted and balanced resolution, which has the merit of pointing out the positive and less positive aspects of the saudi elections and the on-going reform process. </s>
the economic and financial crisis also brought a sharp fall in world trade. </s>
the directive also provides that women must receive the whole of their salary during their lea@@ ve: a significant signal in the current crisis situation. </s>
within the framework of the policy on state support, it makes approval of such support depend on the adoption of restructuring programmes whose basic aim is to reduce further the productive capacity and to bring about drastic cuts in jobs. </s>
following the reading by the committee on petitions, the council has promised to introduce a new practice. </s>
just look at transport policy; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries. </s>
i would therefore congratulate the rapporteur on her commitment and hope that, with more such contributions, we will be able to achieve all the objectives proposed in the europe 2020 strategy. </s>

businesses that use internalisation harness huge resources, but they do not form the market. </s>
that is why the european commission, through its delegation in d@@ ha@@ ka, will continue to monitor the situation and the political developments very closely. </s>
in writing. - small businesses are the backbone of the european economy, accounting for 9@@ 8% of all european businesses and employing up to 60% of the eu's workers. </s>

in point 5, fourth line, the rapporteur wro@@ te: 'the use of guns must be absolutely avoide@@ d@@ .' </s>
considerable attention will be paid to environmental issues and this is necessary in view of the environmental destruction wr@@ ought by ruthless exploitation by the soviet union. </s>
a state that considers corpor@@ al punishment an effective way to prevent crime is not one governed by the rule of law, and the eu should not extend additional trade benefits to such a country. </s>
it is therefore with this information in mind that we must analyse the orientations given in 2003 by the ecb, which were both practical and doctr@@ in@@ al. </s>
with this increase, the budgetary margin still available for agricultural expenditure within the cap will be practically exhausted. </s>
we should therefore support the measures taken to improve energy policies, given their vital importance to the quality of our lives, both now and for future generations. </s>

madam president, ladies and gentlemen, you have before you a unanimous resolution by the committee on economic and monetary affairs to appoint mrs tum@@ pel@@ -@@ gu@@ ge@@ rell as a member of the executive board of the european central bank and to support this recommendation. </s>
the partial political agreement on a common position already incorporates most of parliament’s amendments to the text of the proposal. </s>
that is already a serious matter when the responsibility of the commission as a body is under attack, but it is more serious still when individuals are being named and accused left, right and centre. </s>
now it is time for us to help. </s>
we therefore need a very solid philosophy and we really have to be in step and in agreement about our procedures and policy. </s>
within the complexity and magnitude of the eu's external relations, the space occupied by dialogue and human rights consultations with third countries could go unnoticed or remain in the background. </s>
nonetheless, i do appreciate that concern might be felt. </s>
already scientists inform us that the last decade was the warmest on record and that 2007 was one of the top 10 warmest years. </s>
mr president, yesterday evening, i was really suffering with mr rehn during the press conference when i saw how he had to present this deal, which was not really based on his proposals alone. </s>
you are all aware that, in our home countries, the info-@@ points serve as points of contact for information on europe and the european institutions. </s>
however, what is not so good is that it emphasises the principle of cofinancing, which could undermine the application of the cap and above all affect less-developed areas, which we cannot accept. </s>
we would point out that proposing such measures without first carrying out the aforementioned studies is a contradiction in terms and that we have reservations about and are opposed to any further strengthening of the role of the commission which helps bring about further integration. </s>
nor is there any moral hazard for those who used the most v@@ ile propaganda in the recent irish referendum campaign. </s>
mr president, we have certainly had a packed agenda today. </s>
mr duisenberg, i have been reading your bio@@ graphy in recent weeks and have found it very enjoy@@ able and interesting. </s>
the sitting was opened at 9 a.m. </s>
ian white asked me if i could say anything about the overall costs, but i am not in a position to do so as yet. </s>
it ignores the role played by public services and local policies in terms of land use. </s>
the main reason for such concessions is the growing dependency of the european union energy sector on russian resources. </s>
thirdly, there is still a major debate going on about whether to include schengen in the first pillar or the third. </s>
the cooperation you propose in the new global agreement with the acp countries is important, and represents another addition that we support. </s>
in my view, we can be reassured that our own expectations have also been exceeded. </s>
we will try to do it. </s>
the bureau congratulates mrs fontaine and i personally, as a doctor, thank her for the respect she has shown for the medical profession. </s>
although these floods began three weeks ago, the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire straits mozambique currently finds itself in@@ : there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport, particularly air transport, to get them out of the situation they are in. </s>
they were a reference for democracy in europe, the new frontier of democracy in europe, a democracy that was facing difficult times at that point, having fallen in italy, in greece, in poland, in hungary and in germany. </s>
these new responsibilities affect all of us, whether we are meps, members of the council or members of the commission. </s>
we can achieve that 3 % increase. </s>
however, it includes an ambiguous support for key aspects of the cap reform, against which my group has spoken out, and that is why i will find it very difficult to support it. </s>
tariffs must be measured against the benchmark of the costs of an efficient network operator with a comparable structu@@ re; this is what this house devised and got accepted for cross-border trade in electricity, and it is also suited to the gas networks. </s>
after all, ladies and gentlemen, let us be honest, which of you would volunteer to be tested with new substan@@ ces? </s>
i have not seen a proposal as ridiculous and complex as this one for a long time. </s>
because our regulatory instruments today, even before the reform, enable this open approach to the e-@@ communications framework - it is also bol@@ ste@@ red by general competition rules - this has made markets too open to competition, which in turn has driven the roll-@@ out of broadband access networks in europe. </s>
would it therefore not be prefer@@ able, in respect of turkey, if we were to focus on programme@@ -based progress, or guidance, on the road to a democratic constitutional state? </s>
this is proof positive of the fact that the european union is guilty of hypocrisy when it maintains that it wants to impose equal and fair operating and profit rules, since its very policy takes us in the opposite direction. </s>
it is one of the green@@ est ways of generating power anywhere in the world. </s>
the fact is that in practice anti-personnel mines primarily affect the civilian population. </s>
only a real single market will give us better opportunities for growth and employment. </s>
it is impossible to deal with this issue within the narrow context of the existing member states. </s>
mr president, the president-in-office of the council has discussed various aspects of the process of the eu's enlargement, and these were also addressed in thessaloniki. </s>
the aforementioned deficits must be remedi@@ ed. </s>
but there are a lot of reports which come to this house with a huge number of amendments. </s>
they also include tolerance and mutual respect. </s>
the consequence of that is a lack of satisfaction and 17@@ 8 amendments on the table of this house. </s>
three thousand workers work in state forests, while private ones are run by just 120 officials. </s>
i do not know about other areas, but in the north sea sometimes 50 % and more of the catch of a fishing boat is discarded because it is too small, un@@ marke@@ table, or whatever. </s>
as is rightly emphasised in the report, there is a need to reduce the region's dependence on supplies of energy from russia. </s>
i think that is a p@@ ity. </s>
mr kinnock@@ ' s reform must serve some purpose. let us see whether or not, this time, the aid to alleviate the consequences of the earthquake arrive before another tragic event strikes this sister country. </s>
ladies and gentlemen. i apologize to mrs muscardin@@ i. </s>
secondly, we need to bring the single market fully into play with regard to pensions. </s>
mr pronk criticised me because i demonstrated courage and because, with so many clash@@ es, i proposed article 13 on equality of the sexes and because i have arguments for one and not for the other. </s>
for years the court has been drawing attention to these defe@@ cts, and at last its observations appear to have e@@ lic@@ ited some response. </s>
you will probably be 65 then and i will be a year older than that. </s>
secondly, there were the umts licences, which gave our finance ministers a wind@@ fall. </s>
online gambling offers a new way for consumers to enjoy their gam@@ ing experience. </s>
i am also concerned that the abolition of the development council could be seen as a downgrading of the union's role in development assistance, which must not be allowed to happen. </s>
this is the point at which we must start. </s>
these objectives will ultimately not be compatible, which is why i am voting against the proposal. </s>
it is growing, it is dangerous and it is not usually based on reason. </s>
secondly, there is no arguing about matters of tas@@ te, and on that we are once more in agreement. </s>
the vote will take place today at 11@@ :@@ 30. </s>
it would, of course, be incomprehensible if, after so many years of positive steps under the previous regulation, forest focus were now to neglect the field of forest fire prevention. </s>
secondly, the eu research policy is like a string of lights with 20 specific programmes. </s>
but there is also a need to negotiate commitments by the richer countries to release funds to support developing countries, to help them bear the economic and social costs of the necessary measures. </s>
we are therefore opposed to this european directive, and we call for ports and port facilities, which are useful to society as a whole, to be made a public service. </s>
in this explanation of vote, i reiterate the need to take measures ensuring and promoting stability and security in origin countries. </s>
the action plan that the commission has now proposed to us claims to guarantee safe use of the internet. </s>
we respect these priorities of the people of haiti. </s>
within limits she has done a competent and work@@ man@@ like job. </s>
sadly, in more recent times this appears to have changed, and progress seems to have not only been halted but even reversed. </s>
i note that no amendments were tabled. </s>
we enjoy very active collaboration in the joint parliamentary assembly and, again as mr cornillet says, the parliamentary nature of our work has notice@@ ably increased. </s>
however, what is also important for us as a global leader in the safety process is not to allow these dangerous goods - especially toys - to reach other children - in china as well. </s>
therefore, let us fight unnecessary bureaucracy and let us respect the principle of subsidiar@@ ity; but let us do it not against european institutions but because we want to be closer to our citizens. </s>
these ministerial conferences, the first being regional and the second continent@@ al, identified a series of areas in which cooperation may be reinforced between migr@@ ants' countries of origin, transit and destination. </s>
will it take up this case in the dialogue with the turkish authorities, with the aim of rein@@ stating the mayor and municipal council and ensuring peaceful coexistence for all in turkey? </s>
whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the commission' s own initiative. </s>
pt i welcome the initiatives and the actions undertaken at european level to combat neurodegenerative diseases and, in particular, alzheimer's disease. </s>
the key is to re@@ invest debt re@@ payments in indebted nations to meet those millen@@ ium goals for hunger and disease. </s>
there is a risk of undermining the international criminal court. </s>
that applies, firstly, to the idea that when the council group on police cooperation meet@@ s, those who actually do the work must also be involved, namely the police offic@@ ers. </s>
mr president, our group was pleased with the commission's proposal but even more so with mrs roth@@ behrend@@ t's extremely high-quality and courageous report, because it is likely to be the only one to draw the logical conclusions from the bse scandal. </s>
i simply do not understand the commission. </s>
it will promote innovation in the industry itself through reducing the current existing burdens on companies wishing to introduce new and greener chemicals and through promoting substitution of ol@@ der, more polluting substances. </s>
the progress that has been made has been due not to saddam hussein's having become willing to cooperate but to the resolutions and the threat of military force. </s>
we hope that india and pakistan, with the support of the european parliament, can take that road rather than the much more dangerous road for themselves and the rest of the world. </s>
if the media are to inform citizens objectively about the work of the eu, they must focus on genuine work rather than tit@@ bits or scand@@ als. </s>
the fa@@ ç@@ ade of the new eu house has been built and decor@@ ated; now it is a case of putting the furnit@@ ure in place. </s>
i have named them, in particular, because they put an enormous amount of work into ensuring that we obtained a good agreement on the european external action service. </s>
the adoption of the report proved rather difficult, for problems initially arose with one particular issue in committee, but this matter has now been resolved. </s>
i therefore voted against. </s>
the report was still far too we@@ dded to a fe@@ tish of economic growth which is totally incomprehensible ecolog@@ ically. </s>
we must not surrender to the temptation to open this pandora's box and i congratulate the presidency for stating this clearly. </s>
the current price package comes at a time when the commission has promised to present proposals for reform in various sectors over the current year, specifically the rice, sugar, fruit, vegetable and oil sectors. i hope that these reforms do take place. </s>
the next two years will be crucial here. </s>
we have seen some sof@@ tening of attitudes on the part of the burmese regime. a small number of political prisoners have been released recently. </s>
while we all condemn this, we have stood by and watched his hen@@ ch@@ men murder innocent white farmers and be rewarded by the president for their actions. </s>
i would ask the commission and the council to take press freedom seriously when the negotiations with russia are begun. </s>
this frag@@ ment of the resolution is very important, but sadly the conclusions are not optimistic. </s>
mr president, commissioners, thank you very much for being here today, and i will take this opportunity to speak about cott@@ on, which is a problem for spain and greece, but which i would like the whole of europe to take on board. </s>
there will certainly be problems, but we also recognize the opportunities that a single currency will provide. </s>
the shadow rapporteur z@@ ita ple@@ š@@ tin@@ sk@@ á deserves our appla@@ use. </s>
there are a series of amendments to the agenda, in addition to those announced on 12 may. </s>
today' s vote is a symbolic one. </s>
on research, on the other hand, we have a more directly targeted agenda and initiatives. </s>
as far as the latter is concerned, community programmes for nuclear research are established by the council which, pursuant to article 7 of the euratom treaty, acts unanimously on commission proposals. </s>
because of this i support amendment 8 which calls for such victims to have access to condom@@ s, to prevent further spread of infe@@ ction, and access to abortion in the event of unwanted pregnan@@ cy. </s>
es mr president, thank you for your statement on behalf of our institution condemning the eta mur@@ ders. </s>
there is the problem and there is the challenge. </s>
various people come to you and report a bomb@@ ing, carried out by five terrorists. </s>
that is a major step forward, but we need you to go out there and advocate it in a strong and positive way. </s>
broad@@ band, in my view, is just as essential as electricity to rural regions, and yet many parts of rural europe do not have this basic facility. </s>
on the other hand, we should of course very much like to draw up practical measures and objectives because it is in that way that we can put pressure on the member states. </s>
globalisation and industrial change bring social problems in their wak@@ e. </s>
yet em@@ as-@@ registered companies were not performing better, and the system of environmental excellence was weaker as compared with the iso 14@@ 00@@ 1. </s>
the group of independents for a europe of nations is extremely satisfied with the quality of the report and the amendments proposed by ed@@ ou@@ ard des places. </s>

freedom of expression is the foundation of democracy. </s>
i would, however, emphasise the need to respect life in all its different forms, as well as the strict codes of conduct that govern the handling and use of substances as delicate and complex as these. </s>
in terms of accountability, has the commission sought a report from europol on its apparent failure in detecting and impeding the progress of three international terrorists who fled as fu@@ gi@@ tives from justice in colombia, before publicly appearing last month within the european union, in dublin@@ ? </s>
this is what the treaty requires from us. </s>
mr president, once again we have an annual report, this time for 2001, which contains very serious criticism from the court of auditors on several points. </s>
on our continent, women and girls are being sold like cattle. </s>
this particular enlargement will have major implications for the maritime sector. </s>
there is a need for clarity about who, in the european union, is to bear the costs of additional im@@ positions such as tests and investigations, and conditions for this must be the same from one member state to another. </s>
nevertheless mr skin@@ ner's suggestion of a one-stop shop risk capital website to facilitate the interface of smes and the finan@@ ce-@@ providers is a very good one. </s>
we should not be in this position if the commission had acted quickly, honestly and decisi@@ vely. </s>
fukushima has stirred up this debate and, as a result, many people have changed their views dramatically. </s>
the first is the existence and the particularly active nature of the european branch of the who@@ . </s>
the temptation proves too great for our pro-european sor@@ cere@@ r@@ 's apprentic@@ es. </s>
these countries have only just regained their national identi@@ ties, through historic steps, from the soviet union's great red melting po@@ t, and thus their citizens want to be europeans in a way that does not endanger their national identity or their newly created democratic institutions. </s>
this is an example of prejudice which makes a europe of common values impossible. </s>
applications of biotechnology, for example genetic technology, are used in medicine to help people, e.g. cancer patients. </s>
that is why member states have welcomed the high priority that commissioner piebalgs has attached to making further progress and the recent publication of the green paper on energy efficiency, entitled '@@ doing more with less@@ '. </s>
it must, however, be admitted that not all ratification laws have constitutional status. </s>
this will not only reduce the dependency on social services but will also ensure a higher number of contributors to these schemes. </s>
mr president, commissioner, i am glad that in the last few months we have been able to discuss and approve a number of interesting reports in the house, some of them by means of the codecision procedure, which gives meaning to the single market in the areas of transport and mobility as well. </s>
i do not agree, however, with eliminating the specific line for that young and much-@@ ben@@ igh@@ ted country. </s>
this begs the fundamental question: what relation does the policy of the eu authorities in the field of enterprise bear to the basic principles of the european union, such as european solidarity, equal opportunities, sustainable development or human rights? </s>
last month commissioner de silguy was sounding like c@@ lif@@ f ric@@ har@@ d: '@@ we@@ '@@ re all going on a summer holi@@ day' . </s>
therefore, i urge you: pay a little attention to what is actually happening, in the public sector and in the private sector alike. </s>
we must fight against the loss of interest in development aid and against the so-called crisis of legitimacy which it is suffering. </s>
for many, these misgivings could not, however, be completely resolved, something which finds very clear - albeit only symbolic - expression in the wordings concerning the transitional regulations, such as the following: 'the deadline for implementation of the directive will be 4 years. </s>
however, the substance is the key issue: it is important to ensure that this cooperation focuses on practical cultural needs in the broader sense, on the needs of the cultural and artistic sectors, on simply expanding culture. </s>
mr president, i understand the frustration of my colleagues. </s>
firstly, i hope that the arctic council, as an administrative body, will continue to grow in strength and that the european union will have a strong role to play in it. </s>
i would therefore suggest a provisional figure of 15 %. </s>
mr president, first of all our group did not sign this resolution for a number of very important reasons. </s>
mr president, commissioner, in my view, the council's proposal for a regulation properly has the air of an emergency measure in what is developing into a real crisis, not only from the economic point of view but also because of its political and institutional implications. </s>
mr president, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a sea of difficulties, stages take shape. </s>
the debate is closed. </s>
we shall certainly have new provisions, but they must serve as the basis for the adaptation of these specified rules, and not vice versa. </s>
in any event, the more they teleph@@ one, the fewer votes you will ge@@ t. </s>
many of them were lu@@ red or abducted from poverty and unemployment in the east to be exploited as prostitu@@ tes in the west. </s>
the us position in this regard is, of course, substantially stronger, leading to unfair advantages for our transatlantic partners. </s>
if you look at the existing controls, several member states simply fail to fulfil their legal responsibilities. </s>
the debate which took place in the european parliament and the debate which is taking place today, as well as the final decision which i hope we will come to, show that such an ambitious, great and difficult attempt can be enriched and pursued in this direction. </s>
the group of the european liberal, democrat and reform party has requested that the commission make a statement on the french government' s refusal to lift the ban on british beef. </s>

what i find particularly regrettable is that even the commission is not addressing the problems relating to the pact, and you need to have a better procedure for dealing with them. </s>
the bureau's services will set to work immediately as you are indeed right and we must find out where this list is and bring it here. </s>
we know that there is consensus for a focus on renewable energy, including heating and cool@@ ing. </s>
frontex is currently facing a number of problems. </s>
as the draftsman of the opinion of the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy, i am very pleased to note that my committee and the committee on employment and social affairs are on the same waveleng@@ th on a number of important points. </s>
the system of a and b shares is open and non-discriminatory and based upon purchasing agreements freely entered into. </s>
american companies are already launching the first satellites - well, the experiments failed because of the carrier system, but they are going to keep on tr@@ ying. </s>
so we should give ourselves time carefully to examine the goals and effects of the mai@@ , because the social aspects, long-term ecological feasibility and democratic accountability of the mai should not be subordinated to onerous restrictions - our guiding principle should be just the opposite. </s>
in spite of this, the council also noted some positive sign@@ s, such as greater religious freedom and the non-@@ application of the death penalty for the last two years, which takes us back to the previous question, concerning eu policy matters. </s>
decisions need to be made concerning many details. </s>
we are used to a different technique from her, especially on drugs, but in this case she has been very flexible. </s>
it is my hope that projects like this do not lead to more drugs being smuggled into the illegal european market. </s>
we can count ourselves fortunate that, in hong kong, a political framework was achieved that now, , determines the form that the negotiations in geneva will take. </s>
there is a particular lack of such reforms in germany. </s>
there are all these peculiar little tax havens and exemptions that we seem to allow and where eu law does not apply. </s>
yes, we must do what we can to promote renewable and alternative energies. </s>
the focus should be on international treaties on the environment. </s>
hu mr president, nowadays, the world's food production is facing different challenges to an increasing extent. </s>

secondly, in view of the fact that the uk government is a labour government, and i am a conserv@@ ative, it would be rather strange, to say the least, if i felt obliged to represent their views either in my capacity as chairman of the fisheries committee or indeed in any other role. </s>
we want european freight trains - here the networks have already been opened up - and now also international passenger trains to be able to operate regardless of national borders, because we want efficient rail services. </s>
the temporary suspension of the common customs tariff duties will allow local economic operators in the autonomous regions of madeira and the azores to import a certain quota of raw materials, parts, components and finished products duty-@@ free. </s>
it is not meant to be mining legislation or waste legislation and the future directive on mining waste management should cover safety aspects of disposal facilities. </s>

commissioner, let me begin with a short quotation from a letter i received recently from a company which employs more than 100 people: ‘@@ with great concern we are following the debate on the claims regul@@ ation’. </s>
a government which makes legal assassination one of the pillars of its justice system is infinitely more criminal than those it claims it is protecting society from. </s>

it is much appreci@@ ate@@ d@@ .' </s>
i am convinced that most people, on reflection, would rather see a parliament working positively for change than one which allowed anger and irritation to gain the upper hand. </s>
in particular we have given more attention to territorial cohesion. this includes stronger wording on the urban question. </s>
this means a vast over-@@ capacity today: we have vessels with a capacity vastly exceeding what can sustainably be cau@@ ght. </s>
only strong external pressure on ukraine and active cooperation can help it to abandon short-term and often personal interests in favour of genuine independence from russia, and a legal state that is free of u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous corruption. </s>
that is why we should support the commission' s decision in matters such as world@@ com and spr@@ in@@ t. </s>
this is why the commission remains committed to enforcing its firm stance on anti-competitive behaviour and mer@@ gers. </s>
solutions do exist. </s>
it mr president, mr reinfeld@@ t, ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of points in the conclusions arising out of the latest european council on which we should be able to agree and which we could describe as encouraging for the immediate future. </s>
this speech could be taken as a policy document for the year of intercultural dialogue that has just begun. </s>
unemployment is our greatest problem, as the report states, and the european central bank simply cannot ignore it. </s>
faced with this predic@@ a@@ ment, parliament has taken refuge in san@@ iti@@ sed statements or, even worse, has issued sweeping condem@@ nations which seem to apply to all europeans without distinction and which imbu@@ e everyone with an unwarranted sense of guil@@ t. </s>
it was not even decided to make an adequate financial framework available for the third multi-annual programme for the smes. </s>
what was the position of the united states on the important issue of the kurdish refuge@@ es? </s>
i asked him whether the commission would complement this rhetorical support with any kind of support that did not just consist of words. </s>
only in that way can we give renewed hope to tens of thousands of people who are still dying of diseases that could, and should, have been wiped out a long time ago. </s>
apart from such merely quantitative parame@@ ters, the single cmo will make our market legislation more homogenous and consistent, in other words more easily access@@ ed and read and thus better understood and applied. </s>
. the attitudes shown by countries and by international institutions are always worth more than the words that they speak. </s>
we cannot endorse this transfer of legislative power from democratically elected bodies to the eu commission. </s>
de mr president, the policy of the european union towards belarus is certainly an example of a sensible neighbourhood policy. </s>
no, the reason why the volkswagen plant is threatened with closure is not that liberalism has been mal@@ function@@ ing; it is because there is still no social regulation of the market in europe today. </s>
such an intention was that of the authorities in the countries beneficiary of development assistance, namely to bring the decision-making process closer to them, motivating that they know best what their needs are. </s>
when the committee on agriculture discussed this issue, it also addressed a broader problem of the discrimination of farmers from new member states of the eu. </s>

in the commission's white paper on sport, which was adopted on 11 july 2007, issues such as free movement of sports@@ persons were also exhaus@@ tively addressed, especially in the accompanying document entitled 'the eu and sport@@ : background and contex@@ t'. </s>
a succin@@ ct, consensual and eloquent declaration on that occasion, in the name of the council, the commission and the european parliament, could represent a very positive element in creating a new context for our wider institutional debate and perhaps also in addressing some of the specific concerns which have arisen in the national debates on the constitutional treaty. </s>
i have two final comments. </s>
why on earth are we bo@@ ther@@ ing about that? </s>
to turn the european economy into the most competitive and dynamic economy, based on knowledge and not on the intensive use of resources, will require a better and greater use of market instruments in order to achieve greater levels of efficiency for our procedures and products, but will also require other factors to be taken into account simultane@@ ously. </s>
in my opinion, it is in diversity and technological innovation that we must find the response to the current energy challenges and issues associated with them. </s>
written statements rule 149 </s>
the valencia action plan, the joint justice and internal affairs programme and the programme on dialogue between cultures and civilisations respond to this challenge, to this ambition to give the barcelona process new political impetus, which we all thought was langu@@ ishing. </s>
many honourable members simply wanted to send the commission a warning. </s>
the solution must be a ban on sal@@ es; not just of virgin cfcs which is important and taken on board quite substantially by the european commission and a number of european nations, but a total ban because of the problem of re@@ labelling and lack of control. </s>
that is what we have provided and we all know what the reasons are. </s>
this is not practical and we must have an overall end to the journey. </s>
it is also strange to see this resolution adopted on the basis of rule 10@@ 64 of the rules of procedure, which concerns the election of the entire commission and not the replacement of a commissioner. </s>
this has been the idea from the outset. </s>
the debate is closed. </s>
we see the trouble in our part of europe caused by not managing to set up a proper transport policy in the european union. </s>
the usa has not had the same strict monetary policy as europe. </s>
tomorrow, we will also tackle the wider issue of energy, in view of the energy leak@@ s, spil@@ lo@@ ver, wast@@ age and similar factors in our energy cooperation policy, in the context of which we have, in recent months, already held a large number of technical meetings which have brought great progress. </s>
mr president, as the house knows, my report concerns the spanish initiative to simplify the schengen rules and cut out as much red tape as possible, by allowing group visas to be issued at external borders to seamen in transit, thereby making things easier for member states with a nav@@ y. </s>
this is because of long delays as a result of increased security checks. </s>
the second condition is that you governments must have the courage to speak to the general public about the choices that must be made and the divisions that exist among you on the future of europe, and to seek their support. </s>
let us not delude ourselves, and let us be honest@@ : we are giving money which we are taking right back. </s>
these are major changes geared to public safety and confidence, and they should be put across much more strong@@ ly, because of the far-reaching effect they will have. </s>
what i want, above all, is for consideration to be given to specific geographical characteristics, and one area in particular, which will of no surprise to you: the island regions. </s>
the law needs to be clear and far-reach@@ ing, and must be implemented and correctly enforced by all member states. </s>
mainstreaming means building without obstacles, not first ere@@ cting obstacles and then solemnly dismantling them. </s>
we are not talking about ministers but of a civil servant from the representation of the government holding the presidency at that particular time. </s>
therefore, in this regard, ladies and gentlemen, mr president, mr nicholson, we believed that more extensive impact studies were not necessary, since we had more than sufficient information to produce this proposal. </s>
i would like to give him my sincere thanks for his contribution to the sixth framework programme to establish the european research area - it was his idea - and the new instruments, such as integrated networks, networks of excellence, integrated projects and the st@@ air@@ way to excellence. </s>
at the heart of this action plan is the use of state investment and public expenditure as means of stimulating private spending, the very same thing that you spoke of when you said that the available resources of the european investment bank would be used to this end. </s>
looking to the future, the commission believes that its action should be seen as an investment in responsible fishing, and not simply as a mechanism for compensation. </s>
there is then also the question of an interest@@ -rate rebate on loans. </s>
i think we must also think about the european council resolution put forward in june, which proposed a plan for cooperation in the area of culture. </s>
we now have a reliable framework for that purpose. </s>
moreover, recent developments have sadly highlighted the inability of that team to get to grips with events. </s>
it neither can nor should it be the eu's job to set up a policy for all areas, let alone for the arctic, which is an area where we have traditionally cooperated very well and where only two and not three, as was said here of the countries involved are members of the eu. </s>
the european standards for total pesticides in drinking water have been exceeded in 75 % of the european union's agricultural regions. </s>
this should incl@@ ine us to deny approval. </s>
paragraph 2 add@@ s, in summary, that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest shall be subject to the rules contained in this treaty. </s>
it shall also reflect developments in the medium-term budgetary position, in particular, fiscal consolidation efforts in good times, the level of public debt and sustainability issues, external financing needs, public investment, and the overall quality of public finances. </s>
i would therefore like the commission to give its opinion on how it sees the future of this text. </s>
that is roughly how a number of the member states see the problem of electronic signatures too. </s>
direct control over services and providers must be possible - and is highly desirable - but with due regard for those condi@@ tions: professional qualific@@ ation, contractual and social rules, environmental protection and safety. </s>
there is no time to go through everything. </s>
there are practical considerations involved in how the issue works on the ground which are necessary to explain. </s>
it would be difficult to question your findings and hence the grounds for your conclusions on the basis of the facts. </s>
the systems i am referring to are, for instance, mobile air condition@@ ers, fixed air condition@@ ers, and the system comprising the gas plus the energy needed to make the equipment work. </s>
do you think it is possible to achieve further development together with either mr oettinger or mr de guch@@ t? </s>
the alternative would be to protect only well-off populations. </s>
with regard to mr hatzid@@ ak@@ is@@ 's report, it is particularly satisfying that the council is now permitting the use of old buses until the end of their economic life. </s>
i think that, with your experience in sweden during the 1990s, you are the right man in the right place to do what we have not done so far@@ : devise a single strategy in the european union to combat this economic and financial crisis. </s>
it is unacceptable to trade in human embryos or to create embryos for research. </s>
de mr president, ladies and gentlemen, i would like to start by saying that we, too, in principle welcome the european commission's proposal and this green paper. </s>
nevertheless, we will not achieve the interoperability needed by liberalising this sector. </s>
we are now in a phase of reflection, but this reflection must be made visible and audi@@ ble in order to give people the opportunity to agree with or oppose the ideas presented. </s>
and that is not what the convention on refugees is about. </s>
super@@ grid is the tool that was seen as a mag@@ ical solution. </s>
there is no doubt that human rights and support for the rule of law in the fight against terrorism belong to this shared heritage. </s>
we think the union should help countries, whatever the country and whatever its political regime, which are used to hide illegal activities behind offshore legislation. </s>
it is the culmination of fifteen months of work. </s>
the success of the euro offers the opportunity for very necessary and increased political cooperation within europe. </s>
the most serious thing that has happened is that the negotiations between the ruling party and the opposition parties broke down about a week ago, primarily because of the refusal of the ruling party and the prime minister to even discuss a number of issues related to the need for democratic reform. </s>
as regards the final point, i know that commissioner fisch@@ er-@@ bo@@ el, who is not present today, was rather sceptical about this, which is why it may be worth considering the introduction of a regional system of payments for growing ber@@ ries for processing. </s>
what do we do about individual responsibilit@@ y? </s>
is europe grasp@@ ing for something that it does not need because it already has it? </s>
firstly, the european ombudsman was called upon to continue with his investigation of third-@@ pillar issues. </s>
this is the reading stage, not a final decision, and there have not even been any debates or discussions in the committee. </s>
factors such as intensive soil use, poorly planned urban growth, rural flight and deserti@@ fication, among others, are the causes of an increased risk of disasters. </s>
if the eu adopts strict measures on the use of antibiotics with agricultural animals, we can also expect changes to legislation in third countries, particularly because of the financial losses that would be caused by a restriction on meat exports to europe. </s>
in other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected. </s>
as part of the fight against terrorism, we feel it is necessary to adopt measures for combating organised crime, which specifically involve attacking money-laundering and the various forms of trafficking and abolishing tax havens. </s>
after the events of the last few weeks, i am pleased to hear the message but i lack faith. </s>
the commission needs to think about this. </s>

these are all cutting-edge factors that determine viability and competitiveness, especially the viability and competitiveness of the small and medium-sized enterprises we, the presidency, are interested in promoting and that is what we shall do. </s>
therefore, we need to look at this very seriously, and member states need to stop complaining and start cooperating on a common migration system. </s>
the euro@@ group' s first task in this reinforce@@ d, economic coordination, is to outline the main@@ stays of the euro@@ z@@ one' s economic policy. </s>
that has meant that the italian government has had to concentrate on that problem, which is a real problem, but which has determined the outcome of the european council. </s>
secondly, they should apply the philosophy behind the reformed cap to the new measures. </s>
however, it is forward-looking in that it sees the problems, confron@@ ts them and proposes solutions to them. </s>
there are many fle@@ dg@@ ling industries, such as the ra@@ pe-@@ seed oil industry, that need to be financially promoted and supported. </s>
finally, the commission must give its approval and make sure community law is not contraven@@ ed. </s>
they were a few extr@@ acts from amnesty internation@@ al’s report on the appalling situation of women throughout the world. </s>
i cannot get rid of the suspicion that many people address the reform of the institutions with the ulterior motive of using it to postpone enlargement for a while. </s>
the aim of this supervision is more in-depth supervision, forgive the repeti@@ tion, and reducing disturbances in individual financial entities, therefore protecting the clients of such entities. </s>
in 1999, non-governmental organisations and un organisations received eur 14 million for the benefit of the people who had suffered during the war. </s>
mr president, prime minister rocard is certainly right to stress a number of matters which, indeed, must be included in our overall strategy if it is to produce concrete results. </s>
the first issue has to do with the jurisdiction of the european prosecutor. </s>
if we are actively to combat racism and xenophobia, we must respect the right of asylum, formulate a policy for regul@@ arising the status of all those without the necessary papers in europe and grant nationals of third countries the right to vote and stand at all elections. </s>
this brings to fru@@ ition extensive work begun by the commission almost three years ago, in march 2005. </s>

this agreement is in keeping with our strategy for sustainable development while encouraging our economies to be competitive and guaranteeing the principle of equ@@ ity: if the user pay@@ s, he must not pay twice. </s>
in effect, the monitoring mechanism must form one of the essential parts of the union's general strategy on stabilising co2 emissions at their 1990 level. </s>

it was the right approach, to present an overall view of how we, the european union, intend to deal with this issue. </s>
what i am saying is that my country is very grateful for help and cooperation from its neighbours where necessary, but, in the final analysis, it must be able to act exactly according to its own methods and procedures and on its own initiative. </s>
because the high level of personally imported and smuggled cigarettes and alcohol means that the actual cost of smoking and drinking is cheaper. </s>

fi mr president, as you well remember, commissioner barnier, the european parliament was being consistent in its policy when it opposed the inclusion of gambling games in the services directive, as gambling games are not services as such@@ : they are associated with the risk of addiction and the social costs that go with it. </s>
as you can see, there is a small difference between the two concepts. </s>
some of the speeches i have heard today sound as if we are setting ourselves up as a sort of grand jur@@ y where these countries are concerned. </s>
the communication has been the subject of very broad consultation. </s>
so if funds are not used well, if - mr caudron - black holes are allowed to appear in budgets because state-owned industries are making enormous losses, then we should not be surprised if the money is not available for creating sustainable jobs. </s>

in the european parliament's view, romania and bulgaria are ready to join the schengen area. </s>
many of the emerging powers of asia are also now crossing oce@@ ans, searching for energy elsewhere - in africa and latin america. </s>
with this vote, parliament is thus showing full solidarity and unity with the affected populations. </s>
i ask you, what purpose would be served by favouring a time@@ table? </s>
i therefore believe that, though through a different approach, we did reach our goal. </s>
mr bösch has drafted a creditable report and i would like to thank him for it. </s>

i am not quite sure where it has gone from there, but it would be interesting to know. </s>
poverty cannot be effectively tackled merely by means of administrative regulations, even those which set minimum incomes. </s>
mr president, i would like to thank the honourable members who have taken part in the debate for a useful discussion. </s>
nevertheless, and i am addressing the public who are in the galler@@ ies, this is a very important debate for european citizens. </s>
this report deals with a field of action - globalisation - which is increasingly complex, especially when it comes to environmental problems and the problem of migratory flows, which is becoming more and more important in defining the european union' s role in the world. </s>
it must also be included in the overall institutional mechanism with regard to enlargement. </s>
accordingly, the statements in the report on broadening and tightening the principles for assessment of the cost and impact of legislation deserve strong support. </s>
i would like to say here today that, even for those of us who will not be part of it from the start, it is important that the euro should be a success and that it should become a real platform for growth and employment. </s>
it should also build on the objectives of these common spac@@ es. </s>
explanation of vote pursuant to rule 137 of the rules of procedure </s>
flexibility and vision is all very well, mr alexand@@ er, but the prime minister@@ ’s actions have been successful only in securing the hostility of the countries of central and eastern europe – which thought he was their friend – while gaining not a hint of compromise on cap reform in discussions with governments. </s>
as regards the full deployment of the pan-european in-@@ vehicle emergency call system, the ecall system, the eu member states have a large responsibility. </s>
member states have the responsibility to implement specific programmes to promote the active inclusion or reintegration of women into the labour market and specific opportunities for lifelong learning aimed at providing the required skills and qualifications. </s>

citizens act effectively, mainly through political parties. </s>
bulgaria and romania, for example, are subjected to an unprecedented mechanism of cooperation and verification in the field of justice and home affairs. </s>
the johannesburg summit also reiterated the essential nature of respect for environmental and social standards and human rights. </s>
i have to say that one of the points that is very rarely made is that, until recently, the public sector in ireland was being regulated by the private sector; it was being regulated effectively by the credit rating agencies and the markets. </s>
there may be light in that yesterday israel recognised that the palestinian authority had, for the first time, begun to take serious action to combat fundament@@ alists. </s>
parliament agreed to this proposal </s>
never mind, i will keep on trying and perhaps eventually even the german translation will get it right and we will understand one another. </s>
an economic recovery is in progress, but this does not mean that the crisis is over. </s>

we believe it is important to promote respect for human rights in third countries and we keep a constant watch on what is applied in third countries. </s>
as regards the equivalence decision, it is right to postpone it. </s>
the decision to wage this war was a disaster, and the war itself is one. </s>
it is thus of the utmost importance that we in the european parliament should make our views known on the matter. </s>
like any annual report, this one has its limits. </s>
we cannot expect the li@@ ku@@ d party to applaud the immediate creation of a palestinian state. </s>
support for the public sector, stable, permanent and full employment and a better and protected social security system and social protection system in general should form the backbone of economic policy. </s>
let me be very clear on this: infringement of schengen rules cannot be toler@@ ated, but one element does not exclude the other. </s>
it will enable our institution to conform to the ruling of the court. </s>
without regional roots from which to develop, there can be no foundation and no basis for the future. </s>
a priority - as the commissioner has already said - is to ease the burden associated with recor@@ d-@@ keep@@ ing. </s>
the wealth of experience from the past must lead to the elimination of repeated errors, to greater efficiency, and to the rapid and high quality implementation of the cohesion policy, as well as to a smoothly functioning partnership and greater transparency. </s>
we need to remember that new communication media have in fact liberated interaction between people and ideas and between people and people. </s>
with the proposed amendment, the eib can be allowed to re-@@ invest such funds in the context of fe@@ mi@@ p until the commission decides to close the operation. </s>

with this in mind, we can only welcome the fact that the commissioner for maritime affairs and fisheries, mrs dam@@ an@@ ak@@ i, who is our regular contact, and the commissioner for trade, mr de guch@@ t, are reunited on the commission's ben@@ ch. </s>
secondly, for the benefit of mrs green, who has taken advantage of her position to conduct electoral propaganda. </s>

mr elles, in his resolution, has included the european parliament resolutions relating to tourism, echo, phare and the med programmes, following to the various special reports of the court. </s>

this is a good example for a europe of results, for a union whose actions have a tangible value for its citizens. </s>
you have rightly pointed out that much has been achieved over the last few years: the euro, enlargement, the new constitutional treaty and, in this, the commission too has played an important part. </s>
the submission of a report must be characterised by simple, brief and transparent procedures, which the rapporteur failed to emphasise in his report, so that citizens will not hesitate to make proper use of their right. </s>
the stabilisation of iraq, with measures to ensure religious peace between the different eth@@ ic elements, is clearly necessary in a region such as the gulf where the in@@ sidi@@ ous web of islamic terrorism is so desperately strong and has pene@@ trated so very dee@@ p. </s>
the sad truth is that in every single case, it is the animal farmer who ends up footing the bill at a time when meat prices are unacceptably low and consumer prices remain at an all-@@ time high. </s>
the scope and dimension of our relations should be based on the fact that ukraine is an integral part of a united europe already. </s>
all of those are coming together and will mean that the common agricultural policy will have to evolve further. </s>

this is not a favourable environment either for the creation of companies or for small and medium-sized businesses or, above all, for those companies which are taking a new direction by applying new technologies. </s>

such a development would play havoc with stability in the whole of europe. </s>

the fact that, according to a recent hearing, it transpired that women no longer live all that much longer than men at all, should be added to this. </s>

criticism of that position will not weaken the commission but your actions will. </s>
this phenomenon can be observed, for example, in the new member states, where the scale of the challenges to be faced is enormous. </s>

the time has come for the european commission to reduce the expensive administrative procedures, since they lead to the marginalisation of small research groups and small companies and ngos, which are unable to afford them because of their size. </s>

we have always tried to reverse the un@@ natural division imposed at yal@@ ta. we have done all in our power to enable europe to regain the use of both its lun@@ g@@ s. </s>
that is why, mr president-in-office, it gives such an impressive signal that both you and the president of the commission are here today, a signal that we europeans are united and strong, and that we wish to coexist in friendship and partnership with all our neighbours, on the basis of human rights, democracy, freedom, social well-being and, above all, peace. </s>

many of us believe that if things swing too far in favour of streamlining public finances, the goal of reducing poverty risks becoming a pipe dream. </s>
we need to examine the question of what is more sensible in particular cas@@ es: the eu pilot or the previous treaty infringement proceedings. </s>
but we should not be overly optimistic. </s>
nevertheless, we must also stress the fact that genuine integration requires efforts on both sides. </s>

madam president, ladies and gentlemen, at this point, i can but offer my sincere thanks for the broad support for this proposal from all sides of the house. </s>

does the commission think that there are good reasons for carrying on al@@ one? </s>

the committees of inquiry this parliament set up into bse and cigarette fraud were a great success. </s>
we are now creating a market for the alternatives. </s>
there is no possibility of progress on issues like flexicurity and reform of labour law unless we deal with issues such as workers' security in this area. </s>
any analysis of state aid must be based on a clear idea of differences between income and costs rel@@ ating, on the one hand, to private finances and, on the other, to public finances, that is to say an idea of the existence of external effects. </s>
this measure is justified by the impossibility of using the remainder of the budget for projects involving accession and candidate countries, and by the fact that simplif@@ ying, as opposed to de@@ activ@@ ating, the project would entail losing the unused budget commitments of approximately eur 42 million. </s>
madam president, the resolution is looking at one problem, that of the risks of deep-@@ water dr@@ ill@@ ing, in isolation from the related problem that we are running short of easily accessible oil. </s>
how does the commission assess the current political situation in haiti and the impact it has had on the reconstruction of the country? </s>
the rapporteur therefore quite reasonably calls for the problem to be tackled by means of novel solutions, such as taking advantage of the possibilities offered by the eu staff regulations. </s>
however, in so doing, we are also entitled to expect reciprocity from others. </s>
there is soon to be a new intergovernmental conference which will provide opportunities for further strengthening openness within the union, a process that has already begun with the formulation of rules on access to documents. </s>
mr corbett will naturally have the right of reply, but i cannot fail to note that mrs frassoni used a red card while waiting to try out the blue card. </s>
in this sense it is important that the member states that have coal resources should have a community framework that enables them to continue to maintain access to them and to maintain minimum production to guarantee that access, within the focus on supply security, to minimum indigenous primary energy sources. </s>

there can, therefore, be no doubt that it is appropriate to maintain instruments of support for the outermost regions, as laid down in the proposal for a council regulation presented by the commission. </s>
finally, during the transition period, it is important to prevent the networks from growing further apart. </s>
support for civil society is key to the development of the human dimension of the partnership. </s>
the commission also makes use of the humanitarian aid instrument managed by echo to fund humanitarian de@@ mining efforts. </s>

mr president, the constitutional treaty is dead, long live the treaty. </s>
at some point, sooner rather than later, the european commission - despite its general committee on budgets - will stretch itself too far and all of this wonderful financial engineering involving '@@ back-@@ load@@ ing' and '@@ fron@@ t-@@ load@@ ing' will not be sufficient to deal with so many priorities. </s>

the european commission applies this method rigorously in all areas, including the area of equal opportunities, fundamental rights and non-discrimination. </s>
i also regret that parliament is afraid to speak out clearly when it comes to the subject of crime committed by foreign@@ ers. </s>
in my opinion, this last point is particularly important and could be especially useful in protecting the community's financial interests. </s>
for that reason, the european parliament is proposing an agreement between our three institutions on a method to work together on all these proposals for the future. </s>
it is the view of the environment committee that the budget committee's amendments should be accep@@ ted: they substitute advisory committees for management committees, thus making the whole thing more open and, i hesitate to say above-@@ board, but at least transparent. </s>
well, madam president, ladies and gentlemen, that has got to change. </s>
this is a brain dra@@ in, and we need these brains in order to turn europe into the world's most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy. </s>
the second point that i consider important is the old ch@@ est@@ nut of the ‘@@ brain drain@@ ’. </s>

by making the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities the nor@@ m, they give the member states the means to tackle tax fraud seriously. </s>
how is that supposed to happen? </s>
so i think we need to be very careful in introducing changes of this kind. </s>
the sitting was suspended at 10.@@ 50 a.m. and resumed at 11 a.m. </s>
all the rules and customary procedures may have been violated, but this does not seem to worry mr corbett, flan@@ ked by the committee chair. </s>

part of this strategy is the establishment of the european institute of technology, which has gained strong support within the ppe-de group. </s>
which west german negotiating partners of the gd@@ r were concerned about the fate of the vietnamese immigrant workers in east germany at the time? </s>
- and that of how to safeguard at least those parts of the document that make the charter of fundamental rights legally binding, those that enable the enlarged europe to operate more efficiently and, moreover, those that accentu@@ ate the eu’s social role. </s>
mrs schleic@@ her, the reason i have been so involved in this issue of the novel food regulation is that i believe that we shall be doing the consumer a disservice if we abandon these labelling principles. </s>
i am confident that this will bring member states' positions closer together with regard to asyl@@ um@@ -related policies. </s>
i count on your leadership. </s>
it would have been wrong to allow the summit to become a casual@@ ty of the war. </s>
on the contrary, the agency will have to support the actions of the commission, or rather of both the commission and the member states, without the commission's medi@@ ating, and this is the purpose of some of our amendments. </s>
i felt that i needed to explain our position and say why the uk pse will be voting against this report later today. </s>

in the case of vilni@@ us, in particular, we have a very good opportunity to show how strong cooperation can actually be. </s>
that would not be efficient. </s>
after all, what was slovakia tol@@ d? </s>
it is important that we continue the work such that it becomes even more efficient. </s>
as an english speaker, i condemn this dis@@ courtesy to other members of parliament. </s>
it may be that translating it is taking time. </s>
the days of the beef war - 14 against 1 - government positions ravaged by warring factions in the governing party are, i am pleased to say, over. </s>
what we as the european union expect is that our safety standards are accepted by korea just as we, too, accept kore@@ a's standards in this sector. </s>
colleagues, these despicable crimes are not happening in evil husse@@ in@@ ’s prisons, but in us@@ - and briti@@ sh@@ -@@ controlled and run prisons. </s>
to avoid any risk of margin@@ alisation, it is also important to implement innovative policies on genuine access to employment, and to enable these people, the vast majority of whom are permanently settled, to access decent and affordable housing. </s>
to conclude, i should like to thank all my colleagues for their very positive contributions to the final version of this report. </s>
in the netherlands, this figure was even as high as 8@@ 5%, and in the netherlands, unlike in france, where only the president decides on such things, it is parliament that decides on the subject of a referendum. </s>
i therefore wonder how we are to fulfil our obligations in the best way? </s>
my second point relates to complementary medicine. </s>

it will fall to them – to the men and women of iran who have their country’s best interests at heart – to defuse the mul@@ lah@@ s’ bom@@ b. </s>
i would like to ask the minister whether he agrees that there have been human rights abuses committed by the government's own forces as well as the tamil ti@@ gers. </s>
i am referring to amendments nos 1, 2, 3, 4, the first part of 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 18. </s>
we did not do it because at the time we had not thought about it, we did not have the means and to do it now on the basis of the uruguay round does not make any logical sense. </s>

it is also true that brazil is very important to cooperation in relation to the wto. </s>
if there is fraud in any country, the commission must fight against it. </s>
all that appears is: mr puer@@ ta of the gue group, voting against my group every time. </s>

mr president, we have no doubt as to the importance of a detailed debate on the system of community own resources and we will analyse this document with particular attention. </s>
the commission has answered questions put to it by the parliament to the best of its ability. </s>

in the light of the results of the european parliament's special committee on secret cia flights washington should have been clearly told that progress in transatlantic cooperation on the fight against terrorism can only be based on compliance with article 6 of the eu treaty and full respect for human rights. </s>
then eurojust really will be a success and make a contribution to the people of europe living in greater security. </s>
however, the more progress which serbia and macedonia make in the integration process, the sooner we will be able to resolve the kosovo question and the other related open questions. </s>
it is a fair point, you are quite right. </s>

these countries, in particular, typically had low levels of reporting sexual assaul@@ ts. </s>
mr president, commissioner, ever since the quota system was abolished last year, imports from china have, as has been mentioned, spectacul@@ arly increased by around 5@@ 00@@ %. </s>
– mr president, commissioner verheugen, first of all i would like to express my appreciation for the great work that has been carried out. </s>
i want to see bilateral agreements used to get into multilateral agreements, because the commission must look at multilateral rather than bilateral trading agreements, but using bilateral agreements to move towards them. </s>
the vote will take place at 12 noon. </s>
as regards information on international agreements, there had been a step forward in this area before the governments of the member states intervened and changed the text for the worse. </s>
it looks as though north korea got the blue@@ prin@@ ts from pakistan, but the americans have produced no evidence that it has an ongoing programme. </s>
now we also need a strong and clearly expressed political will to render the exchange and comparison of information as efficient as possible. </s>
i voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because i agree with the idea that europe needs more researchers. </s>
i cannot go along with that, since israel can in no way be sure that lebanon can control the fundamentalist military groups there. </s>
therefore, pressure must not be exerted on eu member states with diverse traditions and legal procedures relating to adoption to liberalise international adoption. </s>
of course, there are different levels of preparedness between the member states and what is important for us is not to grade or categor@@ ise the member states, but to put pressure on them – and my thanks to parliament for precisely this support for me – so that all the member states have a satisfactory level of prepare@@ dness. </s>
everything takes time. </s>
the work we are going to do will be on a very good foundation. </s>

madam president, i wish to make just one comment. </s>
this was not the case, you will recall, on 18 february. </s>

in the future, the cap should to a greater degree respond to social needs, such as job creation and the position of women and young people in agriculture. </s>
for all other european union countries, the criteria apply as from the moment when the conditions are fulfilled. participation in economic and monetary union is automatic and there is no discrimination between member states. </s>
these flexible mechanisms have to be worked out. </s>
mr president, the confusion in the house before voting time is in danger of becoming a moral issue. </s>
this is not the time nor place to go into that. </s>
but what we have to ask ourselves is, what sort of benchmark is it if, when it comes to the crun@@ ch, we shy away from a real policy of educational convergence at european level. </s>
of course we must support deman@@ d; consumption is the only route to recovery. </s>
i should never wish to take away any of the new parliament's powers, and i therefore urge that the new parliament should be the one to decide on the commission, so as not to have to live with a commission on which it has had no say. </s>

the subject is in itself a useful one to debate, and the report contains a lot that is constructive. </s>
however, because they have ignored the unfavourable changes in the new eu member states, the eu institutions must bear part of the blame. </s>

sadly, the consequences of these crimes are devastating and long-@@ last@@ ing. </s>
the fourth is, very practic@@ ally, the avoidance of conflicts of interest among controll@@ ers. </s>
the commission and mr špidla talk of flexibil@@ ity; we of the group of the european socialists in the european parliament have nothing against flexibility. </s>
we believe this is over the top, we believe this is not the way to build europe, and we have therefore presented an amendment, no 24, which allows the regions, under the authority of the state, to defend its prerogatives before the court in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. </s>
this includes, most importantly, ensuring that young people can develop their skills and talent in any place of their choice in any country in the union, irrespective of where they are from and where they train@@ ed. </s>
mr president, i chaired that conciliation meeting which drew up the compromise text. </s>

such a vision will not last without an ambitious, accountable, efficient and '@@ communau@@ tari@@ an' external action service. </s>
furthermore, problems have arisen of people being held for long periods without trial because of bureaucratic delays caused by translation problems and because of the lack of proper legal aid. </s>
the group of independents for a europe of nations supported both the report and the amendments tabled by the committee on the environment, public health and consumer protection. </s>
it is not up to us, as europeans, to say what the composition of these countries' governments should be. </s>
my many years' experience confirms precisely that. </s>
equally relevant is compliance with the urban waste water treatment directive. </s>
let me assure you that such amendments do not cause any particular problem because their purpose is to reinforce the administrative procedure. </s>
mr president, i, too, would like to congratulate the commissioner on this final effort - yes, i who have often challenged him in other forums - and to simply thank everyone for this very rich debate, in which many members have spoken. </s>
nevertheless cuba cannot escape with impunity, and it is vital that we send a clear signal to the authorities that violations of fundamental rights, including a lack of medical care for prisoners, cannot be tolerated. </s>
we did choose to support the specific amendment 9@@ 45, since it cover@@ s, among other things, aid to palestine, even though there were other aspects of the amendment of which we do not approve. </s>
you do not want to get involved in the issue of what will happen to the 150 000 people who will be thrown out into the streets. these young people will s@@ well the ranks of the 20 million unemployed, made job@@ less by your notor@@ i@@ ous, infamous unified market and the policies you implement to promote it. </s>

on the other hand, we must strongly protect comparable production sectors on both shores of the mediterranean, especially farming, in order to guarantee sustainable development and a regulatory framework that is as uniform as possible. </s>
that is why it would be better to aim for one successful operation in five years' time, rather than making changes every year. </s>
i am glad the eu is taking a very clear position on this matter. </s>
the d'ancona report was written in this spirit. </s>
this proposal provides a regulatory framework for financial activities in the eu. </s>

for these reasons the proposal merits approval, but there seems to be no logical reason why parliament's proposals in particular could not be implemented, given that our findings should have carried at least as much weight as those of the specialised associations. </s>

first and foremost, the interests of simplicity and logic dictate that, to finance the convention, member states should have created a fund financed directly from their own contributions and controlled by themsel@@ ves: the convention is, in effect, a unique body, set up outside the treaties as part of an intergovernmental process in preparation for an intergovernmental conference. </s>
