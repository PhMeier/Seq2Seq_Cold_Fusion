secondly, it makes the political and social agenda a priority and recognises that sufficient funding of it is crucial, and consequently it calls for an increase of eur 200 million in order to achieve its objectives. </s>
whilst in france, the debate on the competence and role of the union is particularly anim@@ ated, we have here, with this draft directive, the opportunity to demonstrate that the union is in touch with a society on the move, and that it can listen and respond to its citizens’ desi@@ res. </s>

such an initiative would bring peoples closer. </s>

this situation can be avoided through serious international cooperation and can certainly be overcome through cooperation and the creation of a common judicial and legal area. </s>
many people died or became refugees and cultural heritage was des@@ ec@@ ra@@ ted. </s>
as was mentioned by a portuguese mep, i too am very proud, to be taking part in this debate as a representative of portugal, because we were the first country in europe to abolish the death penalty. </s>

by adopting the '@@ small business ac@@ t' in 2008, the european commission made the first decisive step for these smes by introducing the '@@ think small first@@ ' principle in all areas of legislation. </s>
this is because, not satisfied with supranational integration, which weakens the member states by ri@@ dding them of their sovereignty from the top, or with inf@@ ran@@ ational region@@ alisation, which works from the bottom up, it is language, one of the essential components of national unity of some member states, that is being attac@@ ked. </s>

the rapporteur has also mentioned a compromise to exclude agriculture. </s>
the desire for normalisation is pal@@ p@@ able in many areas of the country and the wish to forget the past and to think of the future is shared by all its inhabitants. </s>
on the contrary, the immediate effect it had was of improving the profitability and competitiveness of the businesses concerned, raising their productivity and strengthening their financial position. </s>
some weeks ago, a documentary from southern sudan was shown on swedish television. </s>
for it to do so, the main eligibility criterion would need to be the contribution made by projects to local and regional development and to the combatting of the structural problems of the economy, rather than to the achievement of the objectives and policies of the european union. </s>
however, it must be said that if we feel the commission could do more, the biggest problem is by far the member states. </s>

the transitional period of five years proposed by the ppe-de group for the entry into force of the directive is adequate and, in my opinion, more than gener@@ ous. </s>
fires are frequent in these areas and it would therefore be a good idea, or rather appropriate to use these people to help prevent fires. </s>
i also believe that the main obstacle to this directive@@ ’s adoption in 1989 and 1996 – the effect of takeover bids on employment and their social repercussions in general – must remain at the heart of regulatory concerns. </s>

for instance, there must be a clear proportionality between the effect of the measures in terms of public order and any adverse consequences they may have for freedom of movement or the economy as a whole. </s>

the commission must see to it that the additional funding is used properly, flexibly and in a way that strengthens the basic structures of society. </s>
the objective therefore is to establish a link between the two. </s>

in today's vote, we saw support for the report concerning innovative financing in the world and in europe. </s>

i support the commission's view that the minimum period for maternity leave should be raised across the union from the present 14 weeks to 18 weeks, with compensation paid at the rate in place for a period of illness, at the very least. </s>

in the most recent directives we formulated for the customs union, we also legislated for modern technology, introducing the electronic customs system. </s>
we did not want to burden the accession of these two countries with the issue of the future procedure, but i hope that we can come to an agreement with the commission and the council today to ensure that, in future, there is a better procedure and a more serious opportunity for parliament to give its opinion on this issue. </s>

with the granting of the european parliament's assent to the conclusion of the fisheries agreement between the kingdom of morocco and the european union today, a new framework for cooperation has been established. this will be balanced cooperation between the two parties in a sensitive area: the conservation of fisheries resources and their economic exploitation, directly or after processing. </s>
there cannot be anyone within the european union who has not noticed the massive increase in energy prices in recent months. </s>

the committee on legal affairs has therefore approved a total of 56 mand@@ ates. </s>

the dialogue that has been entered into is thus a great opportunity, and i impl@@ ore all of you, let us adopt this dialogue together on a common platform supported by all the groups. </s>
this is how the disappointing conduct of the dutch government can be summed up. </s>

finally, let me express my sincere thanks to all those colleagues who have worked on the draft budget now being presented and who have provided their encouragement and support. </s>
this is where we, as europe's parliament, can certainly play an important role with these reports and these debates, and the ase@@ p summits could emphasise this. </s>
in adopting the report on the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, parliament is showing that it is particularly sensitive to this issue and demonstrating a clear desire to find common, definitive solutions to the storage of nuclear waste in europe. </s>
in my opinion the inclusion of micro@@ chips and the frequent exchange of driving licences as proposed by mr grosch entails unnecessary expense. </s>
it could be deleted without causing any problems, together with chapter 4 and chapter 5. in that case, the rest of the proposal and the consultations would not be bad at all. </s>
that concludes voting time. </s>
of course, any deliberate atrocities against civilians by the military must be punished. </s>
mr president, i am trying to be helpful. </s>
i would call on the commission to examine this situation as a matter of urgency. </s>

it is the responsibility of the european union to provide the funding and the council ought to make decisions next friday. </s>
dangerous goods can be more easily detected and made safe, and more clearly targeted investigation of fraudulent operations and prosecution of fraud@@ sters can be carried out. </s>
meanwhile, european elections must be in line with the election systems in each member state. </s>
it would be difficult to deny that the inquiry into the 11 september attacks is currently concentrating on europe and that it shows that, for years now, the terrorists have been centr@@ ing their preparations in europe, which they have used as their base. </s>
we have taken due note of the european parliament’s opinion on this issue, especially that expressed in the recent resolution. </s>
secondly, i should like to reject the argument that making the labour market more flexible would reduce the amount of undeclared work. </s>

i am pleased to commend the excellent report of a colleague who, rather more than is custom@@ ary, took the views of his colleagues into account, and i am ashamed that there are only 25 of us at this sitting, a fact which hardly enhances the credibility of our debate. </s>
cooperation through the network has been enhanced for all members, old and new. </s>
but i should like to inform the house that we shall be putting in for a report. </s>
the member states must not be discharged from their responsibiliti@@ es; the prevention of disasters is and remains a national responsibility, and it is for that reason that i take an extremely critical view of the eu's current acquisition of equipment, which represents what might be termed an attempt at duplic@@ ation, and certainly is not beneficial. </s>
improvement has been possible thanks to the use of new technologies, but i believe that access is facilitated when information on accessibility is distributed as widely as possible. </s>

the socialist group in the european parliament believes that, on a subject of such strategic importance, it would be highly advantageous to present to the commission and council a european parliament position with a broad basis of support. </s>

this is a question of human rights, democratic freedoms and the rights of the kurdish people in turkey. </s>
it has therefore been necessary to harmonise member states' national laws relating to the admission and residence of those third-country nationals. </s>
the budget is funding the extermination of small and medium-sized farming. </s>

for legislation on the budget - and decisions on the budget are another very important prerogative of parliament - there will surely be a need for a special procedure, but the principle of codecision should remain the same. </s>

this means that at the centre of the union, there is a need for an enlarged functional and cohesive market and for better transportation corridors in that area. </s>

i do believe that this really is now the time for european institutions to deal with this problem more seriously. </s>
the situation for italy and libya is, of course, something which my colleagues from italy will speak more about, but this principle must not be violated by anyone or any country. </s>

it is, of course, a matter for member states to organise their arrangements regarding rural post offices as they see fit and in line with their own requirements. </s>

otherwise, the legitimate call for respect for a minority is in danger of turning into a form of reverse discrimination, to the detriment of all those honest citizens who suffer the crimes and abuses of many roma. </s>

mr president, the commission is glad to know that ms od@@ d@@ y's report, which is very thorough, shares the approach and the main lines of the commission's proposal. </s>

the global warming theory has cast co@@ 2, a natural constituent of the atmosphere, as a dem@@ on gas. </s>
mr president, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, i should like to begin by paying tribute to the work of both the rapporteur, mrs gr@@ ä@@ ß@@ le, and the drafts@@ man, mr pa@@ hor@@ , and by congratulating them on the quality of their report. </s>
and to those who are worri@@ ed, let me say again that i have seen no sign of any proposal that any member state should not have a commissioner. </s>
this is a particularly interesting point when we take account of the fact that, with this reduction in environmental pollution, we would also be fulfilling the commitments made at the kyoto conference on climate change. </s>
year after year, the budget of the european union increases and yet the amounts devoted to fishing in general, and to the fisheries agreements in particular, are not growing to the same extent but are diminishing in relative and indeed absolute terms - from ecu 27@@ 8 million to ecu 27@@ 3 million last year. </s>
it is up to us as law@@ makers to draw up rules aimed at limiting the impact of climate change. </s>
there needs to be more rationalisation of the budget, more exposure to competition, more deregulation and a more rapid phasing-out of monopolies. </s>
does this not contradict the principle of technological neutr@@ al@@ ity? </s>
up to now, proposals for this have always failed at council level, as the national regulatory systems were so hetero@@ gene@@ ous, and the frameworks and aid structures so diver@@ se, that no common denominator could be found. </s>
if you indulge me, may i take the opportunity to thank the representatives of the presidency for all the help and assistance they have given my colleagues over the recent months. </s>
mr president, i welcome the finnish presidency, which i assume will be carried out with the usual finnish efficiency and profession@@ alism. </s>
for this reason too the numbers of women meps should increase a one third to a half. </s>
we need to change the process and procedures to ensure that we have a coherent common foreign and security policy. </s>
they will then be able to register the new institution as european grouping of territorial cooperation. </s>
madam president, commissioner, our experiences of recent days involving the al@@ stom affair remind me a little of the story of the man who, when he was asked why he kept hitting himself on the head with a ham@@ mer, replied that it was because it felt so good when it stopped. </s>
if we think about the precautionary principle and prevention, it becomes clear that incentives must be created to encourage companies to have their products tested. </s>
it seems to me that referring to subsidiarity in this context is too simpl@@ is@@ tic. </s>
there are many interests at stake, with many interested parties involved, and, as you yourself, mr monti, recently mentioned in the committee on economic and monetary affairs, some of these interested parties will stop at nothing in their attempt to organise future car sales in the way that suits them best. </s>
the high level of tax in europe weakens the economy and is not leaving private citizens enough room to manoeuvre or enough dispos@@ able income to boost consumer spending. </s>
can you tell us what is happening with that? do you have a date when these measures will be in place? </s>
as if the agreements with argentina, morocco or mauritania were not enough to show how community fishing activities have contributed to the development of this sector in third countries, the new protocol with guinea clearly shows the benefits a coastal country can gain from a fishing agreement with the community. </s>
it is certainly not a partial freezing of meda funds which will cause the turkish government to have a change of heart. </s>
while there is now closer cooperation between the security forces throughout the world, there is no international consensus on minimum standards in relation to fundamental rights and legal protection. </s>
there is a great deal of opposition in greece to the austerity measures, and so it is highly likely that the country will be suc@@ ked into a negative growth spir@@ al, with sharply declining consumer spending even though an increase in that spending is actually needed to pay off the loans plus interest. </s>
i went for a walk across the bridge from strasbourg in france to ke@@ h@@ l in germany and i stopped and med@@ it@@ ated. </s>
whatever may be thought about this language dispute, this case will never become relevant to the eu's charter of fundamental human rights because the charter is aimed at the eu and at the member states when administering eu policy, and as we are aware, the eu has no policy on railway sign@@ age. </s>
i am sorry if people are starting to be made to feel guilty about their feelings or pho@@ bi@@ as. </s>
on behalf of the alde group. - mr president, i, too, would like to congratulate mrs ţică@@ u, who has worked with tremendous dedication on this dossier. </s>
for example, it identifies the long-distance transport of agricultural products and retail goods as un@@ desirable. </s>
on the contrary, we view the new member states as a resource. </s>
i have my own thoughts for you also. </s>
let me begin with trade, because quite a lot of the different contributions focused on that. </s>
this report, completely re@@ modelled by mrs gutiérre@@ z, is satisfactory. </s>
i believe the problem must be approached with due caution but also putting the issues back into proportion. </s>
the data under the pnr agreement will be retained for 15 years, which, i put to you, is excessive and which this report says we do not want. </s>
i personally would like to insist on the need to harmonize not only the conditions of access but also the working conditions for road transport operators. </s>
according to the latest eurobarometer surve@@ ys, 8@@ 9% of european citizens are concerned about the impact of the environment on their health. </s>
the fact is that you have accepted a ban on the substance we are speaking about for certain obje@@ cts, for example tee@@ thing r@@ ings. </s>
this will clearly be of enormous significance for honourable members in the coming electoral process and, as i have indicated, we will be sending people out very shortly. </s>
the word "@@ mic@@ he@@ lin@@ " does not appear in any of the language ver@@ sions, apart from the english. i would therefore ask you to keep the german or french versions as they are and take a vote on them. </s>
let me again stress how far-reaching these reforms are. </s>
we also know that the united states has not acceded to this agreement, so a major international trading nation is missing. </s>
i only need to respond to a few of the speeches. </s>
what is most uncertain in the decision is control by the european parliament. </s>
the responsibilities of the european union and the so-called '@@ international community' are hu@@ ge. </s>
there is now a need to throw real light on all these replies. </s>
there are tens of thousands of participants in the community projects. </s>
i would also like to welcome commissioner michel and to underline his call for good cooperation with our committee on development. </s>
we cannot have 19th or 20th century solutions. </s>
madam president, i shall resist the temptation to reject automatically as in@@ sidi@@ ous or worth@@ less any agreement between two sets of supporters of 'the project@@ ', as it is called. </s>
all this is by way of general comment. </s>
we thank you, president borrell fon@@ tell@@ es, for the opportunity of being here and we look forward to working with each and every one of your countries in the coming months and into the future. </s>
minimum eu rates of duty are sensible and effective in tackling the scourge of smuggling. </s>
the fund has to be streamlined in order to sta@@ ve off this sort of hopeless situation. </s>
the present text, which allows the proposal to be adopted at second reading, only puts forward various technical addi@@ tions. </s>
in addition, many villages and houses have been burnt out and stocks of food and medicines are dimin@@ ishing. </s>
having carefully examined the recommendation for second reading concerning biome@@ tr@@ ics and visa applications with regard to common consular instru@@ ctions, i have decided to vote in favour. </s>
this witness has been missing since september, and this has caused huge alarm amongst the many witnesses who must carry on testi@@ fying in order to reveal the truth and in order to ensure that no crime goes unpunished. </s>
i cannot comment on them. </s>
even basic information on pollution was labelled a state secret. </s>
madam president, the common challenges which stand before africa and the european union are clear and unequivo@@ cal. </s>
i am pleased that the slovenian presidency is making good progress. </s>
the influence of events in building tension in that atmosphere is also very concerning, as it shows that this is not an entirely spontaneous phenomenon or simply the result of clash@@ es, but that in many cases it is being orchestrated to hide the real social problems affecting people. </s>
we can do that and there is a precedent. </s>
when the figures for 2000 are examined, it can be seen that there were errors in seven per cent of the documents. </s>
we cannot compromise on that, yet this is what the committee on agriculture and rural development of the european parliament wants to do for some reason. </s>
i still feel, however, that this is the only course open to us for the future. </s>
the creation of a mechanism whereby the commission can intervene to remove certain obstacles to trade had previously been dealt with in an unsatisfactory manner by the commission, particularly with respect to the rights of trade unions and the right of member states to govern their own affairs. </s>
members that did not speak in either the sitting of 13 november or the sitting of 29 november will have priority. </s>
without good community legislation, it will be very difficult to apply community law properly. </s>
on the final part of the oral question dealing with strengthened governance for sustainable development, this is clearly an essential requirement for progress in the world summit implementation. </s>
this has to be of great concern as it flies in the face of the purpose of the fund. </s>
even the commission cannot tell us exactly what form these implementing provisions will take. </s>
you have responded positively to my request at the opening of the debate this morning. </s>
a serious comparison of the success of the different recovery methods would be useful. </s>
the derivatives are the new lu@@ bric@@ ant gre@@ asing the whe@@ els of the machinery in the specul@@ ator@@ s’ market. </s>
at its meeting this week, the european commission reaffirmed its desire to develop a consistent overall strategy for supporting and developing biotechnology in europe and to present it to parliament and the council by the end of this year. </s>
i hope that the other institutions will follow suit. </s>
i know the commission is monitoring that closely. </s>
if we talk about returns to the tune of ten billion, then i think that this puts a slightly different complex@@ ion on the remark about payment appropriations. </s>
a certain amount of information on what this policy may be like can be g@@ lean@@ ed from president medve@@ dev@@ 's speech in berlin. </s>
better coordination within the commission, a strengthening of the council's authority over human rights issues and greater cooperation with the european parliament, all these would be very welcome moves indeed. </s>
it is important, however, that we do not allow ourselves to become prisoners of old ideas. </s>
i should like to ask the commissioner one question. </s>
the commission' s plans to monitor the policy efforts and policy results at national level more closely are well-@@ intended but will probably have the opposite effect, especially if this is done by means of a quantitative approach: counting the number of measures, aid schemes and employment projects. </s>
we will also have a new commission. </s>
president-in-office of the council. - pt mrs anast@@ ase, in a decision of 19 december 2006, the council mandated the commission to negotiate an agreement between the european community and the republic of moldova on the facilitation of visas. </s>
the principle of transparency must also apply to what is known as comitology. we therefore feel that only advisory committees should be maintained. </s>
we have said that we have the will to do it; we must now show that we are indeed capable of honouring our political commitments without dilu@@ ting them, without weakening and without allowing ourselves to be foo@@ led by tentative signs of recovery. </s>
the adoption of this procedure would mean that parliament would have a more significant role, at least in the strategic financing decisions that the european commission has to adopt. </s>
i always thought that you would be a commission that would be operational from the day of the elections. </s>
mr president, i wish to begin by fully associating the socialist group with the remarks of commissioner verheugen in relation to cypr@@ us; no doubt my colleague mr poos will say more about that later. </s>
we thus made a joint commitment to lead a hitherto un@@ heard of cooperative effort on a global scale, aimed at eliminating the terrorist threat and its leaders, networks and organisations. </s>
there has been an abundance of subjects for initiatives and events during your presidency, as mr david has said. </s>
in order to achieve this, we should give people who have applied for asylum access to the job market, because this is the best way to enable the asylum seeker to be self@@ sufficient. </s>
i can give examples: there is agriculture, but there is also agenda 2000, which fails to meet these requirements. </s>
the european union must mobilise the entire pan@@ op@@ ly of instruments at its disposal to support south sudan in the delicate post-@@ referendum phase. </s>
i therefore obviously support the proposals aimed at repealing the sector@@ ial directives, which were supposed to be temporary and have often continued longer than necessary, resulting in serious restrictions to the freedom of movement and freedom of establishment of european citizens across the union. </s>
yes, we do want a constitution, because the constitution provides us with the chance of a stronger, more effective and more democratic eu. </s>
member states are already allowed to grant fiscal incentives, provided that they comply with state aid rules, particularly the guidelines on state aid for environmental protection, as well as on commission notice on the application of the state aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation. </s>
that concludes the '@@ catch the eye' section of this debate. </s>
it is not unlawful to conclude direct contracts, but it must be restricted to special cases and must take place entirely openly. </s>
environmental concerns must, however, be balanced against the needs of the aviation industry to ensure its success in the future. </s>
digital technology therefore represents, in my opinion, an opportunity for our film industries and an opportunity for us to learn about other cultures in europe. </s>
it allows maximum vari@@ ability from the genetic viewpoint, thereby guaranteeing adapt@@ ation. </s>
in conclusion, then, if there is any suspicion or evidence that abuse and torture have been committed in europe, we shall certainly be in a weaker position in the face of terrorists and anti@@ democratic terrorist propaganda. </s>
moreover, if the collective might of the council is now being brought to bear in an attempt to instil fear into europe, if the fear of immigration out@@ weighs the right of freedom of movement, then europe's spell will be broken, and we shall pay de@@ arly for that! </s>
nevertheless, i consider proportionality to constitute a fundamental principle of data protection policy. </s>
i believe that there is a lot of work yet to be done in institutional terms between council, commission and parliament to prevent this from slipping out of the community sphere, with the result that the finance ministers become the new masters of europe. </s>
it has been a challenging and rewarding six months for us all. </s>
we owe this to our citizens. </s>
he had to set up a police force for which there is neither a legal basis nor democratic or judicial control. </s>
madam president, i also would like to congratulate the commission on reaching the stage of the common position and the rapporteur for all his hard work on these two proposals. </s>
we have fortunately resolved some of the problems relating to bank liquid@@ ity, but new problems and threats are emerging. </s>
in europe we suffered the trials of the war. </s>
this year has sadly been no exception. </s>
they know about unemployment, inflation and the invasion of chinese products. </s>
has the gender dimension been substanti@@ vely integra@@ ted? </s>
as a basic human right, education is crucial for the attainment of other human rights, and investment in early childhood education for roma is a policy that functions on multiple levels and benefits more than the children it aims to educ@@ ate. </s>
fr mr kouch@@ ner, ladies and gentlemen, in january this year, as rapporteur on the south caucasus, i became aware of the danger of an un@@ restrained arms race and stressed the importance of a peaceful resolution to the conflicts inherited from the soviet era. </s>
the union, however, should also take a look in the mir@@ ror@@ . </s>
asylum policies have a direct impact on those seeking protection, as well as on the european union's ability to develop and create a genuine area of freedom, security and justice. </s>
i would like to emphasise that we all share a joint responsibility and it is important that everyone takes full ownership of the europe 2020 strategy. </s>
yet we should not be surprised, for when better to catch people's attention, especially during a cold spe@@ ll@@ ? </s>
then, i should like to tell the french presidency that it can count on parliament' s support to prefer rather that we have no nice agreement than a mediocre treaty. </s>
it is also about aware authorities which accept their responsibility and which recognize the opportunities they have, such as in relation to public procurement, to stimulate the development of more environmentally friendly companies, a development which goes in the right direction. </s>
but what are we going to ask yasser araf@@ at@@ ? </s>
a week ago the chief of staff of the turkish army paid a sudden visit to cyprus and made a number of inflam@@ mat@@ ory statements that almost stopped the peace process in its track@@ s. </s>
finally, of course, i should also like to extend a word of thanks to the representatives of the decentralised bodies to whom we can grant discharge today. </s>
for these reasons, the commission does not envisage the implementation of 100% scan@@ ning in eu ports. </s>
it mr president, ladies and gentlemen, europe has long been like the sleeping beauty on matters of immigration, and we are now paying the price for the time wasted. </s>
in writing. - the call for a harmonisation of the laws on consumer credit across europe is one that i agree with. </s>
the un also recognises that there has been a failure to achieve the target, set in 2002, of reducing the present rate of loss of biological diversity by 2010. </s>
no other parliament in europe will have the opportunity to say yes or no to individual countries; all the others will merely have to ratify the treaty as a whole. </s>
it is, of course, open to discussion how the definition in terms of the words '@@ serious environmental cri@@ me' and '@@ substantial dam@@ age' is to be interpre@@ ted, but that is no doubt as far as the definition goes, even if it is not recognisable in legislation outside the member states. </s>
why should we make life even more difficult for these famili@@ es? </s>
madam president, ladies and gentlemen, commissioner, i think it is rather fantastic that we have now brought about some pretty good legislation. </s>
we can be proud of our response so far to this rapidly changing landscape. </s>
our work on the value of sport, on social and educational sport, will help to bring this about. </s>
looking beyond the technical, administrative and practical aspects associated with the actual implementation of the initiative, i believe that our message must, above all, be political. </s>
in this connection, however, the meeting of the ecofin council held on 13 september last finally seemed to produce encouraging results. </s>
fishermen from other countries use nets up to 2.5 kilometres long and in the bay of bis@@ c@@ ay nets up to 25 kilometres are allowed. </s>
the commission must take account of the special character of the g@@ da@@ ń@@ sk shipyard and give it special treatment. </s>
if charges for road use are unavoid@@ able, then they must take greater account of road damage and emissions. </s>
the decision on distributing the refugees, which is then of course difficult, requires unanim@@ ity; we may as well assume then, that it will not happen. </s>
a round also involves the so-called single undertaking approach whereby, as in previous roun@@ ds, all participants must accept the whole outcome of the negotiations, not just pic@@ k@@ -and-@@ choose. </s>
this is not about the amount of power portugal will lose but a fundamental issue of the type of european construction that we wish to achieve. </s>
i agree that the agency must inform the european parliament on the actions taken to redress this situation and make selection procedures more transparent. </s>
the turkish government has proved its strong commitment to european principles and values by creating a new penalty law to protect women’s rights. </s>
mr president, commissioner, the attitude of the turkish authorities towards current events in di@@ yar@@ bak@@ ir and the management of the crisis in south-eastern turkey are unacceptable from the point of view of the european parliament. </s>
that such work should lead to the eu having to define and implement a european political project does not, however, make sense. </s>
it was manufactured in germany, invented by a hungarian and consists of 27 pie@@ ces. </s>
the council and the commission do not appear to be making much progress here. </s>
this weighting could be based on the weighting in the council, but must build primarily on economic and financial market policy parameters. </s>
with less money it will come down to the commission doing much, but nothing well. </s>
we were charged with the task at the cologne summit. </s>
it has left large parts of the south and south-east off limits for international staff. </s>
i would gladly give you the floor, but it does not make much sense. </s>
as is natural in political debate – and i too am a politician – people do indeed sometimes say: it is we who have w@@ on, and the others have lost. </s>
cooperation among member states and with countries and regions from the eu neighbourhood such as the black sea, baltic and mediterranean opens up opportunities to prevent trans@@ border pollution. </s>
i have not voted in favour of the motion for a resolution, because in my opinion it is primarily a statement of opposition to the right-wing government and does not take an un@@ biased approach to the problem. </s>
the main way to ensure that the individual participants in the stock market act along the same lines is through harmonization and not through voluntary codes of conduct. </s>
if there are problems with the current system of cross-@@ compliance, how are we going to address the potential of further problems if we deepen the requirements on the environmental side of pillar one, which is something contained in the leaked document on the reform of the cap@@ ? </s>
mr president, ladies and gentlemen, this may appear to be a technical report, but in fact it is a very political one, and i should like to thank mrs oomen-ruijten for taking a step in the right direction. </s>
ladies and gentlemen, following that moment of respect in memory of the victims of auschwit@@ z, the sitting is suspended. </s>
madam president, honourable members, allow me, at this point, to make a brief comment on behalf of the council and express how very depressing this topic is for all of us. </s>
mr president-in-office of the council, you have talked a lot about the future, about what the commission will do, and what the presidency will do in lisbon, etc. however, you also said something which i find particularly frighten@@ ing. </s>
in our individual member states, and collectively as the european union, we must exert whatever pressure we can to bring the government and far@@ c back to the negotiating table, under a real ceasefire agreement genuinely observed by all parties to the conflict. </s>
let us call a spade a spade and islam, in its real and current state, backward and mis@@ og@@ yn@@ is@@ tic. </s>
mor@@ de@@ cha@@ i van@@ un@@ u has been elected re@@ ctor of glas@@ go@@ w university in my country, and we would very much like to see him able to come to the university and take up his role. </s>
finally, let me turn to mrs rodríguez ramo@@ s' own-initiative report on multifunctional agriculture and reform of the cap. </s>
indeed, respect for fundamental rights, the situation of refugees and the privatisation of the shipping sector are the most advanced chapters. </s>
yet the importance of our partnership with the eib and with the european union in meeting our commitments, both to our shareholders and to our countries of operations, is clearer than ever. </s>
there are 40 spanish factory vessels in the irish box as we speak. </s>
it has decided to close down a profitable sugar refin@@ ery on the swedish island of got@@ land and is putting obstacles in the way of someone who is interested in taking over the refin@@ er@@ y. </s>
at the beginning, or as early as at the essen council, they were ha@@ iled as the magic remedy for the european union and its development, until the moment came when we realised that what was expected of them was rather unrealistic. </s>
indeed, europe has contributed a very large amount. </s>
kick us out@@ ! </s>
this is an aspect of social policy which has actually generated the most legislation. </s>
much worse, this act would have a pull effect. </s>
such a system is easy to conceive and is also viable, given how s@@ lack certain member states usually are when it comes to carrying out customs checks. </s>
in spite of the numerous requests by parliament, the commission has not made a single proposal in this document with regard to providing for joint financing or for means of carrying out cross-border projects or interregional projects. </s>
that is one of the purposes of this report. </s>
but we have recognised that in britain over 10 million animals were slaugh@@ tered, many unnecessarily. </s>
people say either too much, or not enough. </s>
clearly we must find a purpose for strasbourg. </s>
an information society for all is certainly an area of focus for the commissioner in this process. </s>
we find ourselves in a situation today where the market is extremely difficult. </s>
i must confess i am somewhat surprised at public opinion in europe. </s>
the european council welcomed the commitments to reform the main un bodies, including the general assembly, the economic and social council and the security council. </s>
commissioner, you know that the european parliament has repeatedly prote@@ ste@@ d, with the presidency's bless@@ ing, in order to highlight the importance of farming and preserved food in the region of mur@@ cia, against attacks on lorry drivers and products from mur@@ cia in france. </s>
that requires comparable market liberalisation on the part of other countries that have large textile sectors and markets. </s>
most of our goals were echoed in both mr diamandou@@ ros@@ ’ and mr de ros@@ sa@@ ’s report; however, there are lots of areas to be further improved in order to provide the best possible service to citizens. </s>
most of us contribute constructively on an everyday basis to the attainment of that goal. </s>
thanks to the euro, we europeans now enjoy greater macroeconomic stability, lower interest rates and much more moderate price rises than in previous decades, despite the recent rise in inflation. </s>
we must not allow people to go on dying in the waters of the mediterranean. </s>
my second point - and this has already been touched upon - is that the commission's centralisation dri@@ ve, pursued by means of the authority, the right of veto and comitology procedure, must be firmly resis@@ ted. </s>
this will be especially useful when it comes to iron@@ ing out some of the difficulties which arise for smes during international commerce, especially in dealing with the anomalies created by differing national legislation. </s>
we wish to express our concern at the ever-increasing demand for air transport, expected to double by the year 2010, obviously placing an unprecedented pressure on our safety. </s>
customs officers and other personnel are not answerable to the eu but to their national authorities. </s>
we know that a change in the treaty is needed for this. </s>
there is added value, even for the 15 old member states. </s>
europe must commit itself more to achieving the millennium development go@@ als; in other words, it must devote at least 0.7% of gdp to combating poverty in developing countries by 2015. </s>
does he not know that paragraph 3 in compromise amendment 29@@ 3 is contrary to ecj jurisprudence and the treat@@ y’s provision on the free movement of services? </s>
we welcome the fact, however, that the proposal to include health services in the directive on liberalising services was rejected. </s>
in fact, the member states' contributions are currently paid in national currency and then have to be converted into ecu. </s>
moreover, with the everything but arms arrangement, market access to the eu is free for the least developed countries, and the provisions of the economic partnership agreements epas show an understanding of problems faced by many of the acp countries in guaranteeing food security to their citizens. </s>
firstly, we believe it to be technically wrong and politically surprising that the same legislative text covers both unquestionably dangerous products and ce@@ ment. </s>
unlike the proposed regulation, the report permits european political parties to use their funds to subsidise the activities of national parties and conduct european election campaigns. </s>
the purpose of the report is to establish the european parliament's position with regard to future financing for development cooperation prior to publication of the post-2013 multiannual financial framework. </s>
let me first make a personal comment. </s>
we need to recognise the sovereignty of states in the choices they make in relation to development and their social, cultural and fiscal policies. </s>
the research and innovation union scoreboard mentions that japan and the united states invest a greater percentage of gross domestic product gdp in innovation than the eu, with the gap increasing over the last four years. </s>
i would also like to thank the president-in-office for being here. </s>
we have shared too much pain over the years. </s>
it serves to maintain the current situation. </s>

around the coast and the many islands of scotland, it is a sector that is of the utmost importance and it undoubtedly has not benefited from the political support it deserves. </s>
i voted in favour of the ries report which acknowledges that owing to the influx of new technology since the 1999 report, it is out of date. </s>
the basic objectives of an eu-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability, entrepreneurship and adap@@ tab@@ ility. </s>
fis@@ cal@@ is constitutes the community contribution to this committing but necessary task. </s>
with regard to the more specific proposals, i believe that there are some quite positive aspects in relation to the least-developed countries. </s>
the question of war or peace lies in iraq's own hands. </s>
do you have to do this on an official level? </s>
companies must be made to act responsibly and to apply the existing directives, or be punished. </s>
the political agreement of 17 april 2002 considerably strengthens the text of the common position which was adopted in june 2001. </s>

the lisbon summit gave voice to the possibility of a single market which was matched by investment in training and release of capital through the use of the financial services action plan, complemented by the risk capital action plan. </s>
i have made a study of the nuclear aspects of accession. </s>
but that was not possible, as everyone will easily understand - nor indeed was it at all desirable. </s>
i hope that the commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making. </s>

i wish it every luck. </s>
the eu for its part is prepared to lead this challenge, since that is what our people want. </s>
the '@@ single european sk@@ y' initiative in no way implies the removal of euro@@ control. </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow morning. </s>
mr president, i approve of the méndez de vi@@ go-@@ seg@@ ur@@ o report, which represents an excellent summary of the work of the committee on constitutional affairs. </s>
the intimidation is continuing, the harassment and severe mis@@ treatment of hungarian children has become an everyday act. </s>
the debate is closed. </s>
it is, in particular, the consumers, and i would like to emphasise this point, who will benefit from the new directive, as it affords them improved levels of safety. </s>
the international community, however, has been sparing in its efforts, refusing to recognise that this is in fact a coup d'état and that the government put in place by and@@ ry ra@@ jo@@ e@@ lin@@ a in madagascar is in fact a military government. </s>
i would therefore call on you to voice your support for a hard-@@ hitting reach. </s>
however, the information was classi@@ fied, and the factory was only closed after the communist system had collap@@ sed. </s>
freight companies exempt themselves from having operating permits, work permits are becoming optional for drivers who increasingly come from outside the union, when their driving times verge on the limit and when they themselves verge on sleep@@ . </s>
i invite everyone to read what she said on the previous randzio-plath report. this provides the definite answer. </s>
it is highly impro@@ per, to my mind, to start giving out generous levels of state aid and subsidies, whilst we have not yet sorted out other measures, including patents, making the labour market more flexible, opening up the market for services and many other measures of this kin@@ d; mistakes like this cannot be put right with state aid. </s>
particularly interesting in my view is that this discussion can and must actually be taken further by means of an amendment. </s>
because this is what it says: ' members must declare the assist@@ an@@ ce' - a fine expression - ' that they recei@@ ve' . the problem is not whether or not i declare it. </s>
clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow member states to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualific@@ ation. </s>
research exists to discover things which we do not know. </s>
coffee sector workers are no longer able to make a living from production. </s>
at first reading on 6 september 2001, i spoke in favour of an opt-in instead of an opt-@@ out. </s>

mr president, mr de guch@@ t, ladies and gentlemen, we have already discussed in the previous debate the need to put trade policy into a broader context and to comply with, protect and implement international law. </s>

i have a question for commissioner van miert about his views on legislation concerning z@@ oning and opening hours. </s>

he said it is going to require a delicate touch from those who are on the ground to recognise all the vag@@ aries of the situation that exists in that very sensitive part of the world. </s>

it is parliament's wish from last year and we want to ensure that this money on rec@@ ha@@ r and re@@ tex is indeed spent. </s>
we in our political group, as mr ferber has indicated, feel we have had more successes than failures in this budget process. </s>
should we revoke the customs union? </s>
it is a considerable challenge: in actual fact, it is clear that individu@@ als' ability to access information and process it is a deciding factor not just for their integration into the labour market, but also into their social and cultural environment. </s>
mr president, at long last we have a result. </s>
in the various regulations on structural funds, the council has defined the rules for each fund and, in particular, their areas of operation. </s>
however, there is no mention in your programme of a full@@ -scale strategy on children's rights in accordance with the un convention on children's rights, which was ratified by most european countries. </s>
my thanks to the commission and above all to commissioner marín for the statement on future relations with latin america. </s>
it is impossible to identify precisely where benefits accrue and costs are incurred within a single market. </s>
we know that the next trial hearing is on 22 february. the council will be monitoring what happens then very carefully and we will react in a way we believe is appropriate. </s>
it is the supreme value. </s>
finally, i would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs, but i want to highlight the souchet report, madam commissioner, regarding parliament's loss of power in the consultation procedure, and we obviously have to oppose your proposed reform of article 4 of the basic regulation. </s>
one of these meetings was also attended by the candidate countries. </s>
the euro is just around the corner and the definitive vat system based on the country of origin principle is in the pipeline. </s>

madam president, on behalf of the socialist group, i have to say that we are especially gl@@ ad, at this late stage, to be able to give our views and have a discussion on the european employment pact. </s>
finally, i should like to thank mr cra@@ mer for his work and the sound cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, and express the hope that all those involved will back the processes that have either been set in motion or that are yet to be embarked on. </s>

from the earliest days of child@@ hood, from school@@ days in fact, the key words have been lifelong learning. </s>
i hope too that the debate can demonstrate respect for the word of other governments, the benefits of informed discussion and a sense of proportion. </s>

after the completion of the impact assessment i intend to submit to this parliament in september a proposal that allows the continuation of this scheme but on a very solid basis for the future. </s>
if all rights are equally important, no right is in the end especially important. </s>
commissioner lamy, you have heard here the concerns of my fellow members and now i would simply like to make an observation. </s>
we must thus be careful to see that an accumulation of free trade agreements does not lead to major undesirable side effects in the member states. </s>
the economic and financial crisis which we are still enduring has shown us that, if we move away from the econom@@ y's essential objective, which is to ensure citizens' welfare, we risk pushing the whole of society towards collapse. </s>
in the first act the european parliament pushed through considerable improvements. in the second the council accepted them, but incorporated some catches. </s>
i am not against revis@@ iting this practice but we should do it for all countries. </s>
additionally, wherever possible, the degree of national implementation will be reported in relation to the existing european screening benchmarks in breast and cer@@ vic@@ al cancer. </s>

what are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meet@@ ings? </s>

what is at stake here is our credibility and the credibility of the european union. </s>
the existing rehabilitation regulation is too restricted. </s>
however, we must ensure that similar errors are not repeated in future, especially not in europe. </s>
firstly, we must provide for valid and adequate research to close the knowledge gap. </s>
mr president, i have no problem with that and am happy to accept it. </s>
the objective must be to protect europe's seas and restore them to their former state and to ensure that human activities are conducted in a sustainable way. </s>
the new bill will increase the climate of fear and hostility in a country where persecution of l@@ gb@@ t people is already under way. </s>
the crisis has taught us a pain@@ ful, but all the more valuable lesson for the future. </s>
as regards the composition of the management board of the european drugs agency, the current compromise proposal is preferable both to the initial commission proposal and to the one from the rapporteur mrs müller, which, in my view, contains major deep-rooted conflicts. </s>
our debate has clearly highlighted the need for every aspect of this overall approach. </s>
the external borders cannot turn into a new iron curtain for these communities. </s>
in july, the council followed the commission' s preliminary draft of the budget as far as the international fisheries agreement was concerned, and the council asked the commission only to use these appropriations for other fisheries agreements. </s>
this is not sustainable and this is not in the interests of the people and of society. </s>
eu assistance must serve as a warning so as to ensure a proper electoral process and to guarantee respect for human rights, the aim being to support and advise the people of tunisia in order to prevent any drif@@ ts towards fundamentalism. </s>

fr mr president, ladies and gentlemen, the sand in the kosovo hour@@ glass is tric@@ kling down relent@@ less@@ ly, and 10 december is almost upon us. </s>
however, businesses in the tourism sector - many of which are smes - are not always able to attain these objectives through their own un@@ aided efforts. </s>
a few points are still outstanding here. </s>
the declaration also emphasises the need for economic reform. </s>
we will be discussing this with mr oettinger in future. </s>
there is now more of a need than ever for fresh momentum. </s>
i support the proposal that the commission present reports to parliament twice every year. </s>
the political system in iran does not comply with internationally agreed standards concerning fundamental human rights and political freedom. </s>
the report we are now dealing with also shows that progress was clearly made in this direction last year. </s>
we must satisfy ourselves that medicinal products are only imported if safety and the possibility of verification are given top priority. </s>
this is why we want to give turkey the benefit of the doubt. </s>
does that invitation extend to turkey? </s>
the social climate is not ce@@ asing to deterior@@ ate, over one quarter of the population is unemployed, and naturally the young are the most affected. </s>
there was one further reason, however, for we believe we must make the fullest possible use of all the available means for ration@@ alising and prioritising what we do, moving resources about, increasing efficiency and creating modern management in the european union too. </s>
she is quite right that this is a very serious issue. </s>
we must not hide the fact that many people who are ill are waiting for new therapies to be developed that will offer many of them the possibility of recovery. </s>
more cooperation and resources for the study of cancer and preventive treatment are very important. </s>
this variable is essential. there needs to be a holistic european approach to transport problems. </s>
this is furthermore the only way we will attain the goals of economic dynamism and competitiveness, which are intended to create more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. </s>
it is not a question of the council de@@ ign@@ ing to provide the information. </s>
it is one we address in the communication. </s>
i would warn against simply saying that there will be a vote on it. </s>
it cannot be right that we have to pay for everything which they sit and play with, and that they can then play with the profits afterwards. </s>
but you know what our intention is and i would like to confirm that here today. </s>
that will not put any more fish in the sea or solve any more problems. </s>
the risks will probably be higher next year, because, since the programmes were signed in 2001, the effects will be felt in 2003 under the n+2 rule. </s>
i believe that this will be achieved. </s>
thirty-@@ two authorities from throughout the region, which have protested and which have not been asked about the project, have appealed under greek law to the state council. </s>
we are in a state of tension. </s>
now, it must also be written in such a way that lay persons also understand it. </s>

on the contrary, mr bourlanges, your sp@@ iri@@ ted report leads to a very well-@@ argued resolution. </s>
the next item is the presentation of the court of auditors' annual report. </s>
the european union lists human rights among its founding principles, so much so that their observance rightly constitutes a prerequisite for eu accession. </s>
i also approve of the government@@ al, non-governmental and european humanitarian activities. </s>
i agree with the view of the rapporteur that the member states must introduce quality consultation systems and financial incentives targeted at individuals. </s>
the system is logically unacceptable from the viewpoint of economic exploitation. and from the viewpoint of resource conservation we are deceiving ourselves because our quotas do not account for actual fish mortal@@ ity. </s>
we need to take this action for our own sak@@ es and for the sake of future generations. </s>
this must include, as a minimum, an automatic parliamentary right to subject any wto deal to assent and much greater access to the negotiating brief@@ s discussed within the council. </s>
the committee on budgets voted against this. </s>
in any event it is no doubt more realistic - at least unless we decide differently after evaluating the open debate on the green paper - to go for a directive to begin with. </s>
one can only imagine the trauma that these cap@@ tives and their families have gone through and are still experiencing. </s>
the rapporteur is mr ferre@@ ira. </s>
there can be no question that this issue must be raised during the summit, in view of the ruling handed down by the european court of human rights on the unlaw@@ fulness of the arrest and detention of the russian business@@ man. </s>
thirdly, the foreign affairs committee would stress that lifting the arms embargo could seriously undermine regional stability in east asia. </s>
roma, like any other disadvantaged group, may pay de@@ arly as a result of the crisis@@ 's impact. </s>
that is why i want to thank commissioner busquin for his proli@@ fic efforts to achieve what is, without a doubt, a difficult compromise. </s>
breaking up the debate and giving priority to some aspects and not others is proof that the council does not want to tackle the issue of safety in a serious way and wants to put a brake on the package as a whole. </s>
the committee on budgetary control has on several occasions expressed its un@@ happiness with the poor functioning of the system and the need for its management to be improved. </s>
the eu is facing huge challenges nowaday@@ s: the economic and financial crisis, the alarming rise in unemployment and climate change. </s>
to reduce the seasonal nature of demand, minimise the impact of resource use and waste, and develop a tourism available to all without any kind of discrimination. </s>
that applies across the board but also to particular sectors of industry and, naturally and quite specifically, to the maritime sector, therefore. </s>
as such, it is a little odd that a quick decision cannot be taken on having a salmonella guarantee for preparations which are not heat treated. </s>
it will not surprise you to learn that i am resolutely in favour of the first of these arrangements. </s>
it is a complex and very un-@@ user-friendly piece of legislation regulation at the moment. </s>
we are talking about a document on strategies. </s>
there is a long list of failures to implement and they are primarily a responsibility for the commission as guardian of the treaty to en@@ force. </s>
commissioner bor@@ g, i fully support your work on marine science technology and innovation and your commitment to the ab@@ er@@ de@@ en declaration. </s>
accordingly, we are bound to express our opposition to those who perpetr@@ ate such evil@@ s. </s>
thank you very much for your ability to organise that in parliament. </s>
. the cer@@ cas report, which the meps have approved despite numerous gap@@ s, calls for the deletion of the ‘@@ opt-@@ out@@ ’ clause that the commission proposed to kee@@ p. </s>
however, i must at the same time express my disappointment and that of our group that the report was significantly altered during the voting on amendments in the relevant committee. </s>
i note therefore the reports that the french authorities have said that they will take steps to compensate foreign drivers and that local pr@@ é@@ fe@@ ct@@ ures can provide compensation claim forms. </s>
firstly, last year in october, the council gave political affirm@@ ation, and political confidence to that macro@@ supervision, and, in december, to micro@@ supervision and the whole legislative package. </s>
as if the divergent national interests of the member states had already been consigned to the european past@@ ! </s>
positive developments have recently taken place in eu@@ russia relations. </s>
the european council has repeatedly expressed its commitment to conclude negotiations by the end of this month and to adopt the necessary reforms. </s>
it is important that such activity is developed with social policy in mind and for that we need true partnership. </s>
improving competition amongst port service providers will increase competitiveness and efficiency in ports and contribute to developing goods transport by sea, which is ultimately the main objective of our support for maritime transport in the union. </s>
part of the problem in asia and elsewhere lies in the fact that there are no adequate rules. if there are rules they are not properly enforced. </s>
indeed, in a lot of ways we tend to become so liberal that we forget about pluralism. </s>
just a personal comment at the outset. </s>
may it have a positive influence on the burmese government in the near future@@ ! </s>
the resolution also draws attention to the importance of agriculture in combating hunger and stresses the importance of farmers' incomes. </s>

i would like to ask you why you, yourself, as representative of a parliament, avoid contact with parliamentarians when you visit member states? </s>
mr president, as i stated in this house just a month ago, now that some sort of an agreement is in place, what is still plain is the lack of action on the part of the european union. </s>
the point of consensus is to be able to prepare a second reading of the seventh framework programme scheduled for the autumn. </s>
it is not just that the payments are so low - and that is itself scandalous - but that this has led to real selection of participants. </s>
we must re@@ capture the spirit of the delors plan and two powerful principles contained in the commission's white paper on transport policy, which i am afraid we sometimes all appear to disregar@@ d: investments must serve not just to fill europe with infrastructure but to promote economic and social cohesion too. </s>
we need bold democrats and in this new period we urgently need an exc@@ iting, democratic and genuinely effective europe. </s>
when discussions take place between institutions, that is a good question to raise in that context. </s>
we believe that more confidence should be placed in local politicians. </s>
in unle@@ ashing the power of the single market in a sector that comprises probably 70% of the european economy, the jobs that it will create, and the dynamic effect of that, are sorely needed at the moment in the stagn@@ ant conditions that we face. </s>
most seriously of all, however, it does not recognise the need for a balance between the environment@@ -related economic and social indicators and the fact that the council meeting in gothenburg established a strategy for sustainable development by adding an environmental dimension to the existing lisbon process. </s>
mr president, ladies and gentlemen, i should like to highlight the in@@ comple@@ teness of the report, which talks about immigrant@@ s’ rights without, however, referring to their obligations. </s>
it is no accident that this document, which i shall discuss briefly a little later, is entitled "the monterrey consensu@@ s" . </s>
due to this policy, the rural population is already seven times smaller than in 195@@ 0. </s>
the spread of technology does not mean automatic sharing of opportunities and the enormous benefits. </s>
it is also our sincere hope that the enlarging european union will play an important part in this whole debate and will contribute its experience of problems and opportunities in integrating these various aspects of policy into general policy on a multinational basis. </s>
mr president, on behalf of the socialist group i would like to say that we supported approval of the interinstitutional agreement as an essential building block in re-establishing the credibility of the european union in how it relates to fraud and deals with allegations of fraud. </s>
for this reason, i would strongly urge the commission to put every euro this programme has been granted to the most effective use possible and ensure that there is a one hundred per cent implementation rate. </s>
it is essential that we press the iranian authorities to systematically commu@@ te all death penalties for juvenile offenders at the very least, and to halt the execution of the four young boys who are awaiting execution at this moment. </s>
in energy production, the highest numbers of casualties have been reported in locations where dam@@ s have bur@@ st. </s>
the effects on the labour market remain. </s>
in the post-@@ 11 september situation, the european union has been over@@ sensitive in its approach to the middle east. </s>

this involves consent to safe and legal abor@@ tions. </s>
we therefore call for imported sugar to be produced subject to the same social and environmental standards as sugar produced in the eu. </s>
i should like to thank mrs loc@@ ate@@ lli and express my admiration for the effort she has put into preparing this report. </s>

furthermore, it is quite likely that the european modern and contemporary art market, which is of particular significance for london, will be moved to switzerland. this was, in fact, already evident a few weeks ago at the basel art fair. </s>
the chinese authorities have recently imposed tighter cur@@ bs on the foreign press, making it subject to strict internal rules. </s>
- pl madam president, the middle east also has its christian roots. </s>
there is a lot of truth in that, and i am convinced that people north of the border, and even in the north of hol@@ land, will understand this. </s>
my colleague, commissioner mandelson, who is responsible for trade policy, visited china recently and had the opportunity to discuss the issue with high-ranking chinese officials, including the deputy prime minister, who expressed their commitment to the fight against counterfeiting. </s>
ladies and gentlemen, our debate is running slightly late. </s>
this resolution must also make a firm request to council to adopt a decision on the proposed regulation of the solidarity fund, to facilitate a quicker and more effective response to disasters that member states are unable to deal with alone. </s>
one of the speakers here said there are clearly institutional shortages in this area. </s>
those are objectives of the governments and, already with the meetings which took place yesterday and further meetings today and tomorrow, we are working towards those objectives. </s>
i reiterate that the eu must have a consistent approach and should not extradite individuals to countries where they may be at risk of incur@@ ring the death penalty. </s>
it is thus absolutely clear that there is an urgent need, above all, for consistent action. </s>
– mr president, even though we are all ree@@ ling from the terrorist act in spain, there is a matter on which i would ask you to provide the members of this house with full information. </s>
obviously we are in favour, i am in favour, of zero tolerance, but, if you will forgive me, there is, on the other hand, no such thing as zero risk. </s>
as regards the stockholm programme, we are strengthening and tightening up the regulations for data protection and respect for the rights of individuals, and democracy, too, in a number of different respects. </s>
indeed, as a member of the european parliament who represents the east coast of ireland, this is an issue which is close to my heart. </s>
the issues of echo, tourism and meda have their origins in initiatives and special reports by the court of auditors. </s>
i get the impression that the group of the european people's party christian democrats and european democrats is still living in the past. </s>
last year, we had a rather more pleasant duty to perform on behalf of the member states. </s>
if our foreign ministers had experienced for themselves this atmosphere of a country re@@ awak@@ en@@ ing, as i did last thursday night, they would probably offer even more support for this democratic revival and also threaten - and actually impose - more stringent sanctions on milosevic and his government. </s>
it is also clear that the member states have a very important responsibility and that a great deal depends on them and on how much they are prepared to put into creating real european aviation and a real european aviation industry. </s>
it is a problem that is fairly widespread. </s>
i shall not comment on the case in question, since it is su@@ b judic@@ e and it is not customary for the commission to comment on such cases, but i would like to give you a clear explanation of the commission' s policy on the issue of transmissible diseases affecting developing countries. </s>
people are moving across borders to take up jobs, some people are reti@@ ring to other areas and an increasing number of people are working for periods in other member states. </s>
improve the transparency of estimates and responsibility of project@@ s; </s>
mr president, thank you very much for this debate. </s>
it is a decision which has yet to be implemented. </s>
such a directive is needed, because it will result in unification of legislation in this area and will bring together at union level all the efforts being made to protect the soil. </s>
pl mr president, commissioner, we are today discussing very important issues of employment, social rights and health protection. </s>
look at the uk's superior employment figures noted just now. </s>
on this point, we must insist not only that our aid should be massive but that our programmes such as tacis should be better adap@@ ted, better monitored and better coordinated with programmes carried out by our member states or by financial organizations such as the imf, the ebrd or the eib. </s>
the european union's recovery measures are accompanied by mandatory measures of financial pru@@ dence. </s>
i can assure you, mr president, ladies and gentlemen, that i firmly believe that it is the commission's fundamental task to act as the guardian of the treaties. </s>
the rapporteur states that we need an improvement in pre-school education, which is when people form their habits and skills needed for later learning. </s>
i repeat, mr president, and i will finish with this, that as regards the helms-burton or d'@@ amato acts, the united states did not pay as much attention to our concerns as we are paying to theirs. </s>
that would only serve to fuel the sense among our peoples that the eu remains obli@@ vious to their concerns and priorities. </s>
i would like to focus on two core issues to which i was committed as the rapporteur. </s>
mr president, i hoped to be able to say something before mrs van dij@@ k left. </s>
furthermore, i ask of the commission: is, in their view, the award of eur 4 million to the fishermen by the french government state aid, and would it therefore be anti-competitive and unlawful within the rules of the common fisheries policy? </s>
madam president, ladies and gentlemen, the commission has presented a proposal amending for the fourth time the fifg implementing regulation ec no 36@@ 99@@ /9@@ 3. </s>
how, for example, does the provision of an article of the charter of fundamental rights that says that '@@ any discrimination based on ... political or any other opinion ... shall be prohibi@@ te@@ d' square with the forci@@ ble s@@ nat@@ ching of pieces of paper with the leg@@ end '@@ referendu@@ m' from the hands of member@@ s? </s>
at present, two thirds of energy resources are imported from countries outside the eu, mainly russia. </s>
it is not enough for us to say that we wish to monitor the activities and function of lobbyists. </s>
we are about to approve the european union budget for 2011, which is being done, for the first time, in accordance with the new regime of the treaty of lisbon. </s>
one point that mrs fourtou also mentioned, and with which i agree, is that the directive should not of course create any barriers to competition. </s>
the experiment has also contributed to combating illegal work. </s>
european farmers are operating under strict health and safety criteria. </s>
this is why i voted in favour of this report. </s>
there are a huge number of romanian children who live with their families in other member states and it is important for them to preserve their identity and to be offered the chance to study both the language of the country they are living in and their mother tongue. </s>
if you look at parliament's di@@ ary for 1997, you will find that 8 and 15 september are actually sun@@ days and week@@ -@@ ending days, not week@@ -@@ beginning days. </s>
we members of parliament tried, we made a proposal that the council itself should come up with an end date. </s>
nonetheless, we - and by that i mean europe and the usa - must remain faithful to the implementation of the roadmap. </s>
ladies and gentlemen, the agreement on prevention from sharp injuries is historically the first agreement between sectoral social partners. </s>
the council stated that the need for eu legislation should be noted, and particularly the need for legislation on the recycling of bio@@ degra@@ dable waste by means of com@@ posting and energy recovery in biogas facilities with subsequent recycling of residual material. </s>
it cannot be right, as we approach so important a decision as that on the european constitution, that there should be no campaign of information and explanation, or at least no long-term one. </s>
as the powers that be in ukraine are obviously not unanimous in their desire to shut down chernobyl, we should agree with the rapporteur's view on the commission's responsibility. </s>
it is therefore a compliment that the paper has actually been written and adopted. </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. </s>
this is why this report is important as it forms a link in the chain of discussions and cooperation concerning improvements in the adoption of minors. </s>
as the irish had their chance of rejecting the treaty at this juncture, all the other member states must have an opportunity to move forward, so that the irish can return to their decision when the time is ri@@ pe. </s>
however, there is a wide body of opinion which believes that a democratic state starts and ends with a multi-@@ party system and regular elections. </s>
we are so far behind schedule that it is essential to find a way out of the situation that would enable us to use the sis 1@@ + network after 13 november 2008, i.e. to extend the service provided by the sis@@ net network and to create a fall@@ -back solution with the s-@@ test@@ a network. </s>
but, aside from these observations, the presentation of the budget must be praised as being excellent and thoroughly appro@@ v@@ able. </s>
we think it is better for us to make labour standards an integral part of our other policy areas, such as development cooperation. </s>
you stated this very clearly and power@@ fully and thus sent a message of confidence to the people of austria and to all the other peoples of europe. </s>
i am referring to the requirements concerning contain@@ ers, which are also mentioned in the report by my colleague mr aud@@ y. </s>
as you know, this process started last november. </s>
it is a far more complex and urgent matter, however to reform the individual structures of the eu as items of budgetary finance. </s>
finally, the members of parliament were not sufficiently involved in the preparatory coordination work. </s>
the sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalan@@ che of mergers and acquisi@@ tions, leading inevitably to monopoly situations. </s>
it gives us the chance to consider how to prevent wron@@ gs within the european institutions. </s>
we therefore consider that culture contributes directly towards the development of the cultural education of europeans and indirectly towards economic prosperity, especially in the regions which are most in need of focus and development. </s>
this is why i doubt the value of mr colaj@@ anni@@ 's report. </s>
that is why, more than anything else today, we need to put this regulation in place. </s>
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance. </s>
we must address this issue in the debate on the treaty. </s>
it seems obvious to me that this proposal is anticipating the possible accession of turkey. </s>
in this connection, the question also arises of whether the profitable direct mail sector is to be opened up or not. </s>
furthermore, the majority of these resources must be allocated with a view to involving civil society in the partner countries in common projects and to supporting the mobility of their citizens. </s>
whilst, to a certain extent, a number of the amendments which have been proposed to the report improve the situation, there are still one or two issues which need to be addressed, in my opinion. </s>
as regards the first draft of the council budget, i would like to mention that the commission, when it presented its version, referred to the forecasts of the member states using our analysis. </s>
you should say that the current treaties cannot be revo@@ ked unilater@@ ally, and that withdrawal from the eu is possible only with the consent of all member states; and that, consequently, no member state can be excluded from the eu without its own consent. </s>
reducing vat on services up to the end of this year was the right way to go about it. </s>
one obvious example is the amendment designed to permit a division of the daily rest period into four distinct parts. </s>
thus it is our obligation to do this. </s>
to my mind, however, the immediate conclusion is both simple and alarm@@ ing: all the indications are that the situation with regard to the stock is very much worse than the most optimistic forecasts. </s>
we intend to put the issue of energy efficiency on the agenda, and we will talk about renewable energies. the german eu presidency will appeal for the adoption of specific figures and reduction approaches which are binding. </s>
mrs frassoni pointed out how ridiculous it is to have a situation in which we have 14 000 diplom@@ ats, whilst the united states has 3 000, with the cost@@ /@@ quality ratio of which we are fully aware. </s>
fourthly, i want to make it clear that with this directive we are agreeing a level to which the applicant countries of the former communist bloc in central and eastern europe will have to ad@@ here, and for which they must now prepare themselves. </s>
mr president, ladies and gentlemen, once again it has proved impossible for a delegation from the european parliament to visit the occupied part of cyprus under acceptable conditions in order to form their own judgement of the circumstances under which the greek cypriots and mar@@ on@@ ites are living in the encla@@ ves there. </s>
without investment in europe's rural infrastructure, the eu would not function as it does today. </s>
on this basis, we should to a greater degree be measuring results instead of input. </s>
it sets up mechanisms through which the european union will now be able to entren@@ ch its integration. </s>
now to the second issue; you spoke about electric cars. </s>
it is of course a particular pleasure for me to be able to report on the validation of the mandates of all the members in question, and i believe that not only the chairman of the committee on legal affairs but the whole of parliament may welcome the entry of the meps for the new member states. </s>
the opinion of the committee on the environment, and i quote, ' insists that at present the european union does not have the know-how or experience needed to establish such network@@ s.' </s>
my basic premise is that the range of measures under the common agricultural policy must be developed in a way that takes the special conditions prevailing in northern agricultural areas into greater consideration. </s>
a first job depends very much on that essential link between the institutions offering education and training and the requirements of the labour market. </s>
the vote will take place at the end of the debate. </s>
on our side we should be prepared to respond with a system of european civil justice which does not, as i have said earlier, just add insult to injur@@ y. </s>
our view is that the union cannot accept this kind of blackma@@ il, but must carry out its specific role in the peace process without being treated just as a dispen@@ ser of funds and cas@@ h. </s>
furthermore, i would like to draw your attention to the fact that the single market, on its own, is not a guarantee for europe's success in the globalisation development process. </s>
i am confident that their mission will provide greater trust in the election process and their observations will help confirm the transparency and impartiality of the workings of ukrainian institutions. </s>
i am convinced that the stu@@ bb@@ /@@ friedrich report will eliminate all kinds of prejudices and negative views about lobbying and that european citizens will view lobbyists as specialists who bring knowledge based on practical experience, helping to prevent european legislation from having a negative impact. </s>
the time has truly come to step us the measures. </s>
i think these are two entirely distinct debates, which should have taken place at separate times during this strasbourg part-session, and each one should have been given the importance it deserves. </s>
the bank is still very unwilling to open its accounts and projects up to external supervision. </s>
in the final vote on both the amended proposal and the legislative resolution, it should say '@@ free vo@@ tes@@ '. </s>
this crisis will not be short-@@ li@@ ved. </s>
it is a country rarely mentioned in lists of examples or in key speeches, yet its fate is closely bound up with the european union. </s>
. el the terrorist attack on the usa gives us an incentive to look at the problem of arms exports in a new light. </s>
it is with this in mind that i hope that my committee will be backed up by parliament@@ 's, the commission's and the council's own proposals. </s>
ladies and gentlemen, the eu’s most recent enlargement brought a number of changes to the fruit and vegetable market. </s>

however, we hope that the word '@@ war@@ ' will be targeted against very specific fr@@ inge members of the arab world, for the arab world as a whole does not deserve to be treated as criminal because of the criminal actions of a tin@@ y, criminal minority of delin@@ qu@@ ents who are stateless because of their own inten@@ tional, sen@@ sel@@ ess, barbaric lun@@ acy. </s>
the problems will not necessarily solve themselves if we do not talk about them. </s>
if this case is symptomatic of legal practice in turkey, neither the commission nor the council should proceed to the agenda. </s>
to conclude, i appreciate receiving the conclusions of parliament and look forward to coming to you with proposals for change later in the year. </s>
that request for urgency was approved. </s>
from my own experience, i know that once someone has been there for five years, they will find it very difficult to leave their host country again. </s>
it is indeed the case that enough in@@ k has been used up on the subject of the future of the lisbon process. </s>
we will have to take the worst of both world@@ s: a serious reduction in production with the associated consequences for the economy, including unemployment in our vital agri@@ food sector, and the anticipated market vacuum filled by third-country imports. </s>
the good qualities of the commission and the commissioners are not in question - the problem runs deeper than that. </s>
this budget also supports employment. </s>
d'@@ 66 demands democratic control over european agricultural policy. </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. </s>
i would also like to thank mr fava and parliament once again for having enabled this compromise. </s>
only in this way is the member of parliament able to exercise control. </s>
mr president, it is regrettable, of course, that the first news we had of this report was in the media, as happened last year. </s>
the child is thoroughly confused and lives shut up in a cell@@ ar. </s>
who is to be blamed for this massive sacrifice of human life@@ ? </s>
however, the report does not inspire trust. it makes no distinction between consumption of fin@@ ite resources and impact on climate. </s>
i was personally very upset about the death of orlando zap@@ at@@ a, and i would therefore like, on behalf of the entire ecr group, to express condolences to all of his family. </s>
mr president, i would like to begin by thanking mr garcía-margallo y mar@@ fil for his report. i would also like to thank all those members of parliament involved for their active cooperation in its production. </s>
but there were other points, too, points which i had identified as priorities in my pre-@@ florence address to this house, where progress has been made. </s>
this is not the first time that the commission and parliament have tackled this issue: i will only cite here the commission' s report to the council and parliament, published in may 1998, which did not accept israel@@ ' s refusal to apply the protocol of the rules of origin as laid down in article 3@@ 8. </s>
fifthly, we want a similar instrument to the t@@ ft@@ p, to be introduced in addition at eu level, and, sixthly, we are of the opinion that this is the precondition to reciprocity. </s>
we need to make use of the union's military logistics – not just for member states – to assist in the accessible areas affected and to invest in capacities and their rapid implementation in similar emergencies in the future. </s>
we have also sent documents to the committee on budgetary control even though it is difficult for the commission to make a political commitment for the next commission. </s>
mr pers@@ son is in danger of mess@@ ing up in true southern italian style if he distribu@@ tes all the responsibilities at gothen@@ burg, maybe giving the food agency to helsinki, to a country which, i would argue, is the least suitable location for it. </s>
so what is the resul@@ t? </s>
such a situation has economic knock-on effects and we are duty bound to bear this in mind. </s>
tomorrow, we will have achieved two milest@@ ones perman@@ ently, or at least, that is what i thought before we heard the statement. </s>
it is precisely for this reason that there are two amendments that we tabled as a group, because, in our view, they are missing in the joint resolution. </s>
in modern organisations it falls to the administration of political power or of legislative power to exercise control. </s>
taxes are, of course, a very national matter and one in which the nations' self-determination is important. </s>
in many states, as little account is taken of victims of offences of negligence as of victims who are unable to prove lasting or grave detri@@ ment. </s>
another important aspect of this measure, aimed at job security for women, is the ban on making them redundant during the period from the start of their pregnancy until at least six months after the end of their maternity leave. </s>
in addition to the universal figures of vas@@ co da gam@@ a and mag@@ ell@@ an, portug@@ al’s notable politicians included pom@@ b@@ al, the lus@@ itan@@ ian ric@@ he@@ li@@ eu. </s>
first of all, legal migr@@ ation: we live in a world of increasing mobility, and well-@@ managed migration is in the interests of all partners. </s>
an individual's rights to belief, to religion, to thought and to conscience are interdepend@@ ent. </s>
this is dictated by the geograph@@ y, and also by the geo@@ politics. </s>
cooperation on scientific and technological research between the european union and jordan is identified as a priority in the euro-mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the european communities and their member states and the ha@@ sh@@ em@@ ite kingdom of jordan, which has been in force since 2002. </s>
i therefore welcome the commitment of the slovenian presidency to conclude this process of transforming the code into a common position during its mandate, although i recall, too, that previous presidencies made the same promise to no avail@@ . </s>
i see the refugee camps - people return@@ ing, not quite knowing where their homes were, people coming back from tanzania and people coming across from kiv@@ u in the congo. </s>
because this instrument is no longer available, the range of economic cards left to play is largely reduced to public spending policy, but the freedom of action of the euro countries is restricted in this area too, because they must fulfil the requirements laid down in the growth and stability pact. </s>
let us not forget, however, that the statistics were also european. </s>
security should not be the sole concern@@ ; we should also be concerned with human@@ ising criminal justice. </s>
i think the commission has submitted a sensible proposal here, on the basis of which we can hold sensible talks over the coming months. </s>
clearly the internet world is going to be highly suitable for the commission to set that up. </s>
nor do we wish to provide money for aid for tobacco cultivation since this directly contributes to public health problems. </s>
however, it is not very easy to accomplish all this as we find ourselves doing away with provisions which obstruct the free movement of goods and at the same time taking steps to guarantee maximum safety. </s>
we look forward to the proposals you intend to present on 10 january for translating these action programmes and green papers into action, because we are convinced that we cannot omit any measure that will help to improve the european union's security of supply. </s>
in general, the principle of tax cooperation must take priority over tax competition, in particular, in the context of the work done by mr monti and the reinvigor@@ ation of the internal market. </s>
it is, therefore, a matter of en@@ suring, above all, that these objectives are attained rather than of imposing new objectives that would be un@@ attainable at present. </s>
i thank the president-in-office for doing a sterling job all day here in parliament. </s>
the who standards are based on b@@ athers and not on can@@ o@@ e@@ ists or sailing crew who accident@@ ally go over@@ board. </s>
when they did not listen, things ended badly. </s>
it takes more to shape europe than a few high-@@ flying speeches by foreign minister@@ s; it means working day in day out on europe as our project for the future. </s>
nonetheless, there is an abiding memory of the best moments of all the meetings held and the hours of work undertaken together. </s>
the committee on legal affairs has considered these four cases over a long period of time and is now in a position to make recommendations to the house. </s>
for these reasons, i am voting in favour of the motion for a resolution. </s>
the position is that the proposal on specified risk material has been postponed by three months, from 1 january to 1 april. </s>
mr president, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after what has been said already, it will be impossible for me to be origin@@ al. </s>
they are successes we would never have thought possible only a few years ago: economic convergence and the participation of a broad group of states in economic and monetary union, the beginning of the accession process for new member states, the first steps in implementing a common employment strategy. </s>
we refuse to clearly condemn the united states for the criminal attitude it is displaying at guantánamo. </s>
however, i still have a number of concerns, first of all about echo. </s>
they have now got to grips with "@@ eu@@ " . </s>
this is only a white paper. in making recommendations, i support mrs schörling in asking the commission to strengthen its environmental commitments, rather than relax them. </s>
then you have something like the equal treatment of women by comparing them only with other women and not with men. </s>
the question of whether turkey is fit for entry to the european union is also relevant. </s>
if we do not implement something which will make countries realise that they there will be harsh consequences if they conduct economically irrational policies, we will not get anywhere. </s>
in 1995, for example, the value of transactions on the international foreign exchange market exceeded usd 13@@ 00 billion per day - more than twice the total currency reserves of the industrialized countries. </s>
now it is time to sa@@ ve. </s>
therefore we should vote overwhelmingly to adopt the proposed committee, which will form the basis for far-sighted legislation. </s>
i believe that we need to reaffirm this point, by doing what my group tried to do and denouncing those parts of the agreement in which morocco absor@@ bs sahrawi territorial waters. </s>
it is quite out of order that we should do anything other than vote on each of the points on the voting list. </s>
on wednesday, 1 april 1998, 51 gra@@ ves in the ag@@ i@@ os ele@@ f@@ ther@@ i@@ os greek orthodox gra@@ vey@@ ard in istanbul were des@@ ec@@ ra@@ ted. </s>
i would state that the prospect of accession to the eu by cyprus offers an opportunity and incentive to seek a political settlement on the cyprus question. </s>
furthermore, setting objectives and practical targets and trying out a more simplified and operational legislative framework that is immediately understandable to all actors involved, will certainly lead to greater awareness and to more effective environmental protection. </s>
yesterday russia resumed gas deliveries to ukraine in relatively small quantities that meet less than one third of the normal flow@@ , but decided to use an entry point which, according to the ukrainian company, is difficult to use, and this led ukraine to stop transport. </s>
each year two million european union residents die as a direct result of these diseases. </s>
the officials from sweden@@ ’s ministry of foreign affairs who have been able to visit me@@ h@@ di gh@@ ez@@ ali are not allowed to tell his family how he is. </s>
yet in these various processes the children involved are not sufficiently listened to and taken seriously. </s>
our agricultural policy has been successful in the past, but it has no place in the future. </s>
i agree with the idea that europe needs to find new momentum. </s>
we try to help those in the west bank, palestinians, as much as we can via financial help and in every other way. </s>
that is what we need for the transport sector, and also in general to increase our competitiveness in the right direction, namely towards safety and improved quality. </s>
despite some uncertainty, the message of the tunisian people is loud and clear: tunisia wants to be a stable democracy that fully respects fundamental rights and freedoms. </s>
one point which we insisted on was investment in public service broadcasting, without which it is impossible to operate to high standards. </s>
this measure has two purpos@@ es: on the one hand, it encourages ren@@ unci@@ ation, as it gives a way into other markets for these facilities and, on the other hand, it promotes a sector such as biofuels at a time when there is so much talk of the need to increase supply. </s>
far from it, in fact. </s>
we want to encourage mr almunia to prompt the commission to put forward a new proposal of 201@@ 8 and we want to amend two points in the report that has been adopted. </s>
we must help, and we want to help, so that a sustainable process of normalisation can take place. </s>
on the cross-border transfer of registered offices, the commission agrees that companies should be free to move their seat within the european union, provided that the rights of shareholders, creditors and employees are guaranteed. </s>
spot checks in the country of origin, physical checks on the borders combined with improved information about the destination country, independently of bse, can show a way to the future here. </s>
the region's strong presence, and the absence of effective local employment legislation, obliges us to ensure that the new agreement lays down robust rules not only of an economic nature but also, above all, as concerns employment, the environment and human rights, thereby limiting the effect of social dumping. </s>
when adopted, i hope that the targets set by the commission will be met and we do not repeat the situation we had with old fri@@ d@@ ges when the directive gathered dust on the shelf until it was too late to implement it in time. </s>
i believe we have the right and the duty to do so. </s>
we need then to strengthen international cooperation and direct action for min@@ e-@@ clearance and also to identify measures to assist the victims of mines. </s>
by the same token, the framework strategy for gender equality encourages an employ@@ abil@@ ity-@@ oriented approach and women’s access to jobs in the new technologies sector. </s>
the terrorists of hamas, for example, will not be eliminated by se@@ aling off the west bank and gaza strip, or by keeping thousands of palestinians in prison - measures which are causing an increase in unemployment, and a deterioration in the living conditions of the people in those territories. </s>
mr president, let me first of all say that i had no objection to postponing my business in order to allow the important debate on violence against women to take place. </s>
i now ask myself if there are still a number of things which we do not suspect of being able to enter the chain but which do, in fact, end up there. </s>
the council has always made it absolutely clear that progress on each of those tracks is inter@@ linked, that we cannot make progress in one area without being able to demonstrate that we are making progress in others. </s>
last month the authorities did, admittedly, intervene in the share markets to prevent speculation - successfully, according to reports i have read - but in my view this was a one-off measure. </s>
i hope that we can be in active contact with the european parliament during the process, because parliament has shown a very keen interest in these issues of climate, which is welcome considering how important this is for our future. </s>
by the same token, they give the green light to those who are included in their tight circle of corruption. </s>
those are just a few examples of what this regulation has been accused of. </s>
when man seeks to play god, nature has an uncomfortable habit of reasser@@ ting itself. </s>
the rapporteur has made every effort to convince his fellow members of the need to increase the co-financing rate to a maximum of 7@@ 5%. </s>
this could allow people's opinions to be recor@@ ded, which would be evaluated later on and incorporated as part of our decision-making process. </s>
success means achieving substantial progress towards a stronger, more integrated union, which will inevitably involve reducing the role and powers of each state, that is the problem, mr michel, and increasing the role and powers of the common institutions. </s>
the broad consensus reached within parliament means that the final vote should hold no surpris@@ es, and so i will start by saying some ‘@@ thank y@@ ous@@ ’, for which i will otherwise run out of time. </s>
what i am interested in are results. </s>
let us do what we can to see that the doors are opened again. </s>
i hope that this will set a precedent for other areas. </s>
finally, i would like to congratulate commissioner vitorino, who expressed very well the need for a balance between security and flexibility as essential factors for competitiveness and productivity in europe. </s>
but that negle@@ cts the growing economic and social substance of the european union, the unique opportunity it offers to channel relevant action on health protection and promotion for its citizens. </s>
the first is that an overwhelming majority of this parliament wants to bring about a quick ceasefire. </s>
that is precisely the attitude of those parties to the elections and to european affairs - a total lack of involvement. </s>
we believe that genetically modified crops should be totally banned in member states, as should imports of products showing traces of gmos. </s>
this macro-economic indicator ignores the quality of products, fails to measure sustainable economic growth, and excludes other factors such as subsistence and sub@@ urban economies, household work and voluntary work. </s>
the need to identify specific duties that the nom@@ adic communities must assume is clear. </s>
however, i do believe we are at a crossroads for the future of the eu. </s>
based on your overall political support, the commission would like to proceed with proposals to set specific tolerable risk levels, budget heading by budget heading. </s>
the following changes have been proposed: </s>
we respect the international role they have played in the fight against global terrorism. </s>
the sis is a necessary safeguard to secure the normal functioning of the schengen area and it should definitely be left open to future comple@@ ments. </s>
the european union has taken on the role of setting an example in the fight against climate change and in promoting environmental quality. </s>
the broad economic guidelines are the mechanism by which we can guarantee much greater economic coordination. </s>
however, we asked you to hold off from voting on the legislative resolution to give us the opportunity, as rapporteurs, to negotiate with the council and the commission to sustain parliament's position. </s>
that is why we believe it is right, given also that the maastricht treaty commits us to aim for a high level of public health, to propose a common framework of basic restrictions and reference levels under this recommendation. </s>
the same report states that these eur 1 0@@ 19 million which have disappeared as a result of fraud are only the tip of the ice@@ berg. </s>
the question remains to be answe@@ red: will we be allowed to do it legally and will this fund actually mean improved ability to deliver on the groun@@ d? </s>
as the smallest community initiative in existence, we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected. </s>
in addition to the human suffering, madagas@@ car@@ 's biodiversity is under threat. </s>
my answer was that they are often not sufficiently integrated, but that they can live out their own beliefs and have their own mosqu@@ es and places of pra@@ yer. </s>
the second indicator is the maintenance of a high level of consumer confidence after a considerable improvement in recent months. </s>
the vote will take place on wednesday, 10 march 2010. </s>
if we wish to guarantee the security of europe's citizens, the answer lies rather in improving social security and social services than in stepping up polic@@ ing. </s>
there is a risk, therefore, that they will intervene in a way which is discriminatory. </s>
then it will no longer be possible for the second richest country in this union to be a net beneficiary because of this - crazy - agricultural policy; then our fellow citizens of the union will no longer accept such a policy. </s>
yesterday, internal discussions were held between the three institutions to consider the progress achieved. the cashman report is certainly helpful in identifying areas where there is scope for improvement. </s>
next, i think that we should, when speaking about the candidate countries, avoid any conditionality which is not linked directly to their capacity to be interoperable with us from the legal, institutional, political and cultural point of view and to compete with us within the internal market in the broader sense of this concept. </s>
every provision of the resolution has its own profound sense, and responds to problems which life often brings in relationships between men and women, when women and children frequently become the victims of force, unbridled violence and injustice in crisis situations. </s>
the drought in portugal is extremely serious, as we know, and as mr borg has just described. </s>
i am extremely pleased that we in the committee have been able to unite in supporting the proposal, and i hope that this will also be the case in the vote in the chamber tomorrow. </s>
fi madam president, our group is divided on this. </s>
i certainly welcome a shift to fuels that are less environmentally harmful, but not in the way proposed in the report. </s>
bg madam president, the economic crisis and difficulties which all member states are experiencing, although to varying degre@@ es, has given impetus to nationalist and populist groups which are not only looking for greater public support, but are also constantly testing european citizens' limits of tolerance by acting openly against the expansion of integration in europe. </s>
we know that it is a very small one, but it acts big@@ . </s>
they are making demands here and now for food, housing, education, that is to say, all the things which we in the western world take for granted. </s>
the eu is simply letting itself be tri@@ fled with. </s>
in this respect, mr nassauer is right. </s>
it is totally incredible that the members of the european parliament might be paid by someone other than the people they represent. </s>
we campaigned and worked hard for the customs union which was adopted by this house by a majority of just one vote. </s>
they have likewise agreed that there are links between the routes and the content disseminated via them and that these links must be duly acknowledged and taken into account in the interests of cultural variety and democratic opinion-@@ forming within society. </s>
i am convinced that political relations between the eu and moldova will be reinforced through the eastern partnership and the negotiations of the new association agreement. </s>
ets has proved its worth and been taken up as a global standard for providing economic incentives for emission reductions. </s>
admittedly, not all of the national plans for reform are equally ambitious. nor, it is true, are they all of the same quality. </s>
we are having what we call a spring summit, we are on the threshold of enlargement, a new intergovernmental conference is about to be held, and there is very little in the budget, yet i still want to believe that there is still time to set a new course. </s>
i should now like to say a few words on the impact of recent events in brazil on european industry. </s>
the case before the court of justice concerned an environmental protection directive that carried criminal penalties and was the subject of the di lello report of the committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs. </s>
our economic activities at sea and on the coast produce 40% of eu gdp and all forecasts suggest that there is still a great deal of potential for growth. </s>
i shall try to reply briefly to some of them. </s>
let me conclude by expressing my thanks to the slovenian presidency of the council. </s>
there is also still a huge amount to be organised in terms of legislation. </s>
we are calling for all environmental legislation to be subject to codecision and qualified majority voting in council. </s>
although at this stage the council's priorities for the 2000 budget have not been identified - these particularly depend on the results of the agenda 2000 negotiations - it seems clear that the aim of most of the delegations is to ensure that community expenditure does not develop more than national expenditure. </s>
i have had a long telephone conversation with the ukrainian energy minister. </s>
mr president, i read about this case last year and did the only thing that i could do. </s>
with regard to this excellent report, i would like to make it clear that, hopefully, it is the importance of up@@ bringing rather than education that needs to be emphasised when we are talking about small children. </s>
the council's reply is disappointing and once again i must deplore the lack of autonomy and courage in the decisions of the council of ministers. </s>
as a result, the presidency is beginning to examine this draft directive at working party level. </s>
the commission cannot endorse this view, because these appropriations must be adopted as absolute amounts. </s>
whereas everyone should be encouraged to speak other languages in this chamber, let me note that you began your speech by saying '@@ mer@@ ci@@ , mon@@ si@@ eur president@@ '. </s>
we know that if member states have to sanction each other, nothing will happen. </s>
that is an asylum policy which we will not support. </s>
i broadly support the proposed measures and feel that it is vitally important that the specific characteristics of each area are properly taken into account. </s>
however, on this occasion, the politicians got it wrong. </s>
in other words people have got their hands dirty with this substance of such great importance to us all. </s>
according to the rio declaration of 1992, it must be scientifically proven that a new product will have no damaging effects. </s>
france's interests are different in all three cases. </s>
we therefore support the resolution which will be put to the vote in the house today. we urge the commission to play an active role in these processes of regional integration, demonstrating strong support for and solidarity with latin america, and facilitating the emergence of stable, democratic and highly developed societies. </s>
the accession negotiations with turkey could be used as a lever to make progress in the area of human rights, in this case women's rights, but it would appear that we have made a conscious decision not to do this. </s>
a swedish veto in the council against a bad compromise is a better alternative than a new long-term budget. </s>
today, 11 years later, the majority of people in russia feel insecure and have no trust in law and justice. </s>
i would like to stress the importance of the contribution by mrs barsi-patak@@ y, whose expertise and diplomatic t@@ act helped to negotiate the renewed referr@@ al. </s>
it was absolutely beauti@@ ful@@ ! </s>
it is not true that only the christian democrats, the socialists and the greens thought that 28 march might not be a particularly good date. </s>
furthermore, whilst the fight against terrorism has to be a priority for the european union, so must the protection of fundamental freedoms. </s>
existing legislation, policies and structures, however, are still insufficient to respond to the whole range of questions raised in connection with protecting children, whether they are victims of poverty, trafficking, domestic violence, sexual abuse, pornography, child labour or the outrage of child soldiers that persists in the 21st century. </s>
in these cases, however, it is the ministers who speak and not the commission. </s>
also, in preparing and following up the commission communications announcing the new governance structures of the so-called eu semester that were adopted in may and june 2010, the commission discussed its proposal with many stakeholders alongside the european parliament and the council and promoted vigor@@ ous, broad-based debate of the issues. </s>
the commission must consider in this regard the feasibility of introducing a carbon tax, similar to vat, to be applied to any product on the internal market. </s>
please, mr bru@@ ton, at the special meeting which you are organizing in dublin, try to raise the ambitions of the prime ministers. </s>
we must also develop regulations to reduce greenhouse gases. </s>
a legal basis must be created as regards the application of a safeguard clause in the event of emergencies which may occur in the european union in connection with animal feed products and which may pose a serious risk to the health of humans or animals and the environment. </s>
the current intolerance could be coun@@ tered and the number of attacks against albin@@ os reduced in future by penalising those guilty of murder whilst at the same time undertaking fundamental awareness-raising work within tanzan@@ ian society. </s>
as the old ad@@ age says, '@@ prevention is better than cu@@ re' and certainly we have to try and prevent natural disasters based on recent trends, to get out some kind of a forecast and to put preventive actions in place. </s>
this leads me to put two questions, the first of which has to do with how this defence policy is to develop in future. </s>
not as an act of relieving my conscience but - al@@ so@@ ! - as a reaffirm@@ ation of a determination to fight. in a practical way. </s>
i must say that i see more in the practical approaches, in switzerland for example, than in the theoretical considerations. </s>
reducing environmental destruction is one of the priorities of the british presidency and so it is timely that we are discussing this report now. </s>
i do not wish to see the ‘@@ suffici@@ ent@@ ’ category deleted as this would lead to some beaches in this category being labelled ‘@@ poor@@ ’. </s>
in view of the excessively indebted national budgets, there is nothing left for europe to do but to strengthen the economy by means of structural reforms. </s>
in addition to this, governments should make public time@@ lines and action plans on how best to monitor and ensure this kind of implementation. </s>
the commission, for its preliminary draft budget, should - we believe - have worked on the basis of the resolution approved by this parliament in relation to the green paper on the reform. </s>
as mentioned, annex 3 is mainly concerned with agricultural dischar@@ ges. </s>
what is more, there are no serious attempts in the debate to assess external effects. </s>

in many respects, it was a successful presidency, i would like to acknowledge that quite clearly, certainly as far as agenda 2000 is concerned and the furthering of the enlargement process, and also concerning the difficult decisions relating to the balkans and security policy. </s>
for this reason we think that placing arbitrary limits on the free movement of persons within european territory would be a serious step backwards for the european integration that we so much dream of@@ .' </s>
some solutions, however, are expected to come out of it. </s>
this respect cannot be imposed, but is an essential prerequisite for our mutual understanding and common action. </s>
member states have committed to the practice whereby loading ports are obliged to assess the condition of vessels and, if necessary, stop the ship from leaving without repairs being done if the risk is considered to be too great. </s>
it is not just the cost to the farmer of taking the necessary precau@@ tions. </s>
this is only right and proper. </s>
i very much value the work done by mrs jack@@ son. </s>
i also believe that it is through this dialogue that we will find the appropriate framework for encouraging our partners to make further progress in the field of governance. </s>
moreover, the eu, in spite of all its limitations, is a major global actor whose weight must be properly recognised at every level. </s>
so, to conclude, and in the interests of efficiency, pluralism, coherence, fairness and liberalism, please support the committee's position and reject the amendments. </s>
brazilian sugar bar@@ ons are the beneficiaries of the recent sugar reform, while 4 000 irish sugar beet farmers have been made redundant. </s>
while i agree with reviewing the legislation on an ongoing basis, it is both premature and dangerous to repeal the legislation at present. </s>
how much added value can be expected from this has also been stated earlier. </s>
i will have the opportunity of meeting the turkish negotiator tomorrow in pra@@ gue. </s>
mr president, the development of the european public health policy has now reached a very important stage. </s>
we have asked in our oral question particularly about whether member states are required to include an evaluation of the social impact in their reports that they submit to the commission. </s>
in addition, the process of simplifying the procedures must continue. </s>
this is the direction we must concentrate on in future. </s>
we cannot open the borders until passage across the external frontiers and the rules on asylum and visas have been settled. </s>
third, overcoming gender stereotypes in education, training, the labour market and in the media remains an important challenge in all countries. </s>
i ask you, commissioner, to tell me if, first, the european commission would encourage the greek government to invite the president of cuba to athens during the olympic games and, secondly, if the european commission sees such an invitation as a positive action. </s>
let me now turn to the investigations. </s>
madam president, as the confederal group of the european united left/nordic green left, we are against the extension of the monday sitting, which will serve only to get the anti-terrorism package approved. </s>
in fact, the reports on the condition of the economy in the various member states are systematically taking account of this issue in analysing the situation. </s>
however, in the short term, we will do what we can for madeira and i welcome the commissioner's statement to that effect. </s>
the sanction applies here to the offending employ@@ er, whilst the migrant is considered to be the victim. </s>
the rapporteur, mr casac@@ a, has worked hard to produce this painstaking report. </s>
those provisions are there, they bind us at the moment and there is no reason to have to suffer any intimidation from our american friends. </s>
so reform of the institutions is clearly necessary. </s>
that is not what solidarity is all about and neither is it something we can defend. </s>
we cannot accept today, within the european union, the most vulnerable having to pay for the adjustment policies. </s>
you cannot imagine not only the lives we shall sa@@ ve, but also the money that the member states will save by applying programmes which address this specific sector, especially heart disease and cancer. </s>
as this will not happen of its own accor@@ d, we need to look into the applications that could strengthen social cohesion. </s>
– madam president, today is not a day for delivering eu@@ lo@@ gies, nor is it a day when we should be saying that the law – european law – has been broken. </s>
clearly, the circumstances of the past year - what with the commission' s departure and the reports by the committee of independent experts - provide a reminder that we need to secure for ourselves a foundation which can give us confidence that resources are being administered in a reasonable way. </s>
half a century later, the soviet union and the communist regime also collap@@ sed. </s>
all member states and the entire weapons industry in the eu must observe strict controls and transparency provisions. </s>
in truth, as rapporteur, i cannot ignore the notion that closer cooperation would, above all, have some virtual effectiven@@ ess@@ : it would hardly ever be used, but one hopes that the risk of its use would do away with one block@@ age or another. </s>
today, the european dynamic is again under way and we meps shall finally get to address issues as sensitive as the crisis in the dairy sector or even last winter@@ 's gas crisis. </s>
so i welcome this on behalf of the commission and on behalf of the high representative. </s>
we have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the commission to put forward proposals, so i should be grateful if the commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern europe-wide postal system. </s>
at the same time, it must be clarified how the european union means to deal in future with the countries that are still wavering between russia and the eu. </s>
this clearly implies a bi-@@ zon@@ al, bi-@@ communal federation with political equality, as defined by the relevant resolutions of the un security council. </s>
unfortunately, however, we spoke little about the context and, by contrast, we allowed a school of thought to bur@@ ge@@ on that the problem was actually in the text. </s>
on 12 june the constitutional council announced the official election result confirming that id@@ ris@@ s dé@@ by had won a second term in office with 6@@ 3% of the votes. </s>
first of all, a reference to reducing unemployment. </s>
it is because the world meteor@@ ological organisation's figures are clear - they are average figures. </s>
mr cohn-bendit, this is the problem, as well you know, with points of order. </s>
thank goodness for that. </s>
mr president, commissioner, it is expected that the basel committee will, this autumn, come to a decision on the equity capital of banks in the future. </s>
terrorism and economic crime these are the two vague labels which are used to conceal the open and violent treatment of so-called enemies of the state. </s>
belarus was used to block euron@@ est. </s>
i find this difficult to believe. </s>
nevertheless, problems could arise in some areas. </s>
the important thing, as far as this subject is concerned, is that we should endeavour to think of all of the aspects, namely - and i put them in al@@ pha@@ be@@ tical order - culture, the economy, the social aspects and technology, as a unity and to treat them equally and not promote one aspect one day and another the next. </s>
the needs of our environment and biodiversity should be paramount in this area. </s>
two turned out to be christians, the woman and her son. </s>
i am saying this with regard to the protocol. </s>
as shadow rapporteur for mr sterck@@ x's report, i would like to express my full support for the document put to the vote. </s>
our citizens are as@@ king: how do you intend to solve this problem? </s>
that requires more efficient and effective development cooperation and assistance policies. </s>
the third report concerns drinking milk. </s>
this is a complex area that we are closely monitoring as part of the ongoing reform process. </s>
there is no room for any form of consideration for paramilitary activity, other than its persecution, dismantling and condemnation. </s>
europe's small and medium-sized enterprises lead the way in translating social standards into reality. </s>
mr president, i rise to raise what may seem, on the face of it, a rather m@@ und@@ ane issue: the implementation of the european water framework directive of 2000 in ireland. </s>
the commission has entered a reservation against this decision. </s>
the third step is to set up a tribunal for the purpose of punishing those who have committed such cruel acts, so that law is upheld and justice is done. </s>
rapporteur. - madam president, firstly i would like to thank all the people who shared their knowledge and expertise with me when i was preparing this report. </s>
the impact will also have consequences for european cultural industries, first and foremost, because of the delay that europe would encounter in terms of the whole library digi@@ tisation project. </s>
this is also relevant to enlargement. </s>
it is alleged that the purpose of the pipeline is to guarantee german@@ y’s energy supply, but that is only half the story. </s>
madam president, i come with two questions for the commissioner. </s>
we have received some information that would have been more appropriate during the course of the debate which has already taken place on the report. </s>
furthermore, i think we are right to emphasise yet again that the eu was actually founded on measures to combat all forms of racism and xenophobia and indeed all forms of discrimination. </s>
although we as yet have no certain proof that the rules for compliance with the kyoto agreement and the mechanisms will turn out to be good rules, it is still completely feasible to establish sound rules in the planned timetable. </s>
for the governments in russia, turkey and israel, it will become easier to op@@ press chech@@ en@@ s, kurds and palestinians when the eu wants to be on good terms with them. </s>
so today we can confidently say that the european community will be a stable community, and it is clear that processes which were started in the past are justified in the present. </s>
in his excellent report, mr frute@@ au welcomes the progress in relations between the european union and the o@@ cts from an institutional, economic and financial point of view, even though there remain many questions on the commission' s proposals having to respond to the objectives included in declaration 36 with regard to the o@@ cts annexed to the treaty of amsterdam. </s>
with the lisbon treaty now in force, this house has acquired increased powers and our working relationship with the commission must adapt accordingly. </s>
i would like to end by emphasising that neither the first nor the subsequent railway packages will resolve the social conditions of employees. </s>
however, you did not utilise this opportunity. </s>
you said just now, mrs barsi-patak@@ y, that any transport policy must be able to be constantly up@@ dated, for the very reason that it has to adap@@ t, and you have underlined the importance of making this growth in transport sustainable. </s>
in paragraph 5.@@ 4.@@ 1 of its proposal the commission rightly states that moderate alcohol consumption appears to offer some protection against cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease among people over the age of 45, but i believe it is a my@@ th, based on very weak scientific foundations, to say that a little alcohol is good for you. </s>
so we do have a problem. </s>
we all want to significantly reduce the quantities used and the toxicity of the various ingredients in deter@@ gent@@ s. </s>
where are the states@@ men and states@@ women of europe? </s>
it was a good example of how the common foreign and security policy works in bringing member states together and it preserved the integrity of the international criminal court. </s>
the ambiguity of the european union purpose when we come to the enlargement policy is an obstacle which no rapporteur could overcome. </s>
i understand that this will be a formal motion. </s>
the debate is closed. </s>
the blame here lies with the member states. </s>
we are voting against the resolution in its entirety. </s>
of course we need to distinguish between irregular migrants and migrants in need of international protection. </s>
we have distinguished between ur@@ ban, sub@@ urban and regional traffic, allowing for exemptions, but only when these have been defined by member states and on condition that they are subject to scrutiny by the commission. </s>
the first is the much lower economic growth rate and higher unemployment in the countries of the european union, and in the euro zone in particular, than in the usa and in the emerging markets such as china and india. </s>
the latter would have led to the circumven@@ tion of employee participation. </s>
mr president, the european union is the largest exporter in the world today. </s>
this ambiguous european attitude is at the crux of the problem. </s>
mr president, madam commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, virtually five months after the beginning of the provisional application of the fisheries agreement between the european union and morocco, the european parliament is now giving a favourable opinion on this agreement. </s>
we say this because we are at the crossroads of intellectual curren@@ ts, and it follows that it is our mission to medi@@ ate, and especially to medi@@ ate between east and west@@ .' </s>
everyone thought that the current institutional framework - a centralised monetary policy, a stability and growth pact, and the coordination of the other economic policies - would enable the differences between member states to be overcome, or at least reduced. </s>
the commission also has a problem with bringing forward the date of its report on the implementation of the programme, as proposed by amendments 3 and 27. </s>
let me say something on other subjects raised at the summit. </s>
ladies and gentlemen, the choice of legal basis is never an innocent choice. </s>
it is to be hoped that tomorrow’s summit will be one of the factors that enable the eu member states to launch a long-term policy of measures to prevent the undesirable effects of globalisation. </s>
we should be aware that iraq's policy is to award gas and oil concessions to countries supporting the easing or lifting of un sanctions. </s>
the first guiding principle should be that of non-discrimination. </s>
ideally, we would like see that we side with the weak, for whoever observes this world at war is bound to see that this is all about inequality of power. </s>
the same applies to the world meteor@@ ological organization and the un framework convention on climate change. </s>
it will then be possible to trace food and its component parts back to the place of origin, in accordance with the transparent production chain. </s>
i do not think that europe's lack of concern about the mediterranean matters much. </s>
the creation of a standard dispute settlement mechanism is intended to provide streamlined and effective redress procedures within fixed time limits, which could increase the security and the predictability of bilateral trade relations, thereby improving the functioning of the euromed free trade area. </s>
pt with this initial report, on which the rapporteur is to be congratul@@ ated, we hope to contribute to the definition of a strategic framework for freight transport logistics in the european union. </s>
by voting for the censure motion we are casting a vote of confidence in europe's institutions and declaring our complete awareness of parliament's role as the protect@@ or of the citizens' rights and freedoms. </s>
we have repeatedly supported the commission in its efforts to achieve an outcome on the fraud prevention agreement. </s>
within the european association for railway interoperability ear@@ i they have set up a working group which now has methods and experience available for transposition to conventional systems. </s>
we must be far more critical of member states which do not make sufficient provision within their national debts and budgets for dealing with demographic problems. </s>
the evasion of european employment law in practice must bring consequen@@ ces@@ ! </s>
now there is an opportunity to grow. </s>
let us not think that our european criteria are criteria that should be adapted to afghanistan. </s>
in fact, the basic principles of international humanitarian law, which are contained in the geneva conventions, are values which must be maintained as a basis for european construction and promoted through institutional activities. </s>
i want a single market in services, but i will not accept the '@@ country of origin@@ ' principle, which will give us a lower level of social services and will undermine the faith that millions of people outside europe place in us to lead the way in creating a better world. </s>
we are not working at council level here. </s>
written statements rule 142 </s>
we can give many good reasons for that. </s>
however, products imported into the eu from third countries very often do not conform to those same high standards. </s>
we are reaching a stage where the european union is faced with potential budgetary gri@@ d@@ loc@@ k. </s>
we do not share the vision with regard to trade in raw materials contained in the report. </s>
now that we have a similar organisation in the council its work is even more important. </s>
at the same time, however, it must be made clear that progress is needed before accession. </s>
the debate would be preceded by consultations with the social organizations such as the economic and social committee and other social players. </s>
low income, bad social security and low chances of improvement are the start of social impover@@ ish@@ ment. </s>
sixthly, the eritre@@ an police is forcing members of non-@@ registered churches to sign statements in which they renounce their religious convictions. </s>
therefore we wish to support the wording of amendment 17. </s>
we have to find new working methods that fully respect parliament’s position as co-legislator with the council. </s>
what action has the commission taken, and what future action will it take and when, to ensure compliance without dela@@ y? </s>
people are sca@@ red that the international bodies will not take enough account of the koso@@ van people' s strength. </s>
the role of the national parliaments must be increased, not decre@@ ased. </s>
there again we have already proposed pilot countries involving the largest number of member states. </s>
military might, political persecution and taking away the freedom of people who, in defiance of all repressive measures, continue to fight for democracy - all these must not be tolerated. </s>
as i have said to parliament on many occasions in the past, action towards a smoke-free europe is one of my main priorities. </s>
i believe i have covered most of them in my introductory remarks, but let me stress a few points. </s>
question no 7 by h-04@@ 18@@ /99: </s>
the second proposal states that it should be possible to apply reduced or even zero rates of vat to goods linked to education, social security and culture. </s>
this area should also continue to occupy its rightful and important position within the framework of community assistance provided under the cards 2000-2006 programme, article 2 of which explicitly mentions aid for the return of refugees and displaced persons. </s>
that means that not all the proposals and amendments were of my making. </s>
it would bring about rumours and feelings of uncertainty among consumers, as a substance that has been approved safe by an independent scientific committee is being questioned again for absolutely no good reason. </s>
the current uncertain economic situation and financial unrest are putting the ecb under great pressure. </s>
in its opinion on mr lan@@ g's report on an eu biomass and biofuels strategy, our committee already attached special importance to the introduction of an eu certification system. </s>
as rapporteur, i maintain my position that the erika package will help to improve maritime safety but i am afraid will not prevent another erik@@ a. </s>
the gender pay gap is still there. </s>
at this moment, we do not have at our disposal specific details of the ideas proposed by the french president on this matter, so i am not in a position to comment on them for the time being. </s>
above all, you should now, moreover, as one of the leaders of the enlargement process, show solidarity towards our new member states. </s>
... but also is a requirement for entry for candidate states. </s>
parliament’s special role inside the accession process is surely to promote the growth of parliamentary democracy in turkey. </s>
europe cannot be a play@@ thing of destin@@ y, a destiny plo@@ tted by others. </s>
first of all, there is no basic economic link between the increase in milk quotas and the fall in market prices. </s>
we could have this on thurs@@ days and on fri@@ days. </s>
more and more, customs administrations, legislation and procedures will secure the internal market, contribute to consumer protection, support the external aspects of common policies and, at the same time, contribute to the facilitation of our international trade. </s>
he will of course need a certain time for implementation. </s>
we would particularly like to say that these are crimes for which we should show no complac@@ ency, and that these measures must be applied in cases where the children involved are under 16 years of age, which is what we voted for in committee. </s>
furthermore, it is our view that the necessary fight against terrorism cannot be used as an excuse to bro@@ ach fundamental aspects of the sovereignty of the union's member states. </s>
i should like to congratulate all those involved, particularly parliament’s rapporteur, mr cornelis@@ sen and his team, the irish presidency and a number of previous presidencies on this achievement. </s>
as mrs mathi@@ eu said, this is a compromise. </s>
the wiebeng@@ a report has undoubtedly shown that we need solutions. </s>
as you know, this is a very crucial and decisive time for the whole enlargement process and especially for cyprus. </s>
. on issues relating to the labour market, i strongly condemn the glaring inequalities between men and women in a number of areas such as pay, access to employment, vocational training, working conditions and career development. </s>
they will also know that they cannot get patents for trivial business process inventions that should not under any circumstances be paten@@ ted, and will be discouraged from applying for them. </s>
perhaps we should also make additional efforts to reach a consensus on minimum taxation between all member states, possibly by agreeing on an appropriate timetable. </s>
the nation that pione@@ ers the energy of the future would be the pioneer nation of the 21st century, he said. </s>
madam president, we fully support mr bon@@ o's report, which i think will also be seriously examined by commissioner fige@@ ľ@@ , so that he can discuss and continue his creative work. </s>
your financial stability mechanism is a vicious weapon dictated by the markets, mas@@ quer@@ ading as something ben@@ ign@@ . </s>
secondly, special emphasis is placed on what the report calls 'the feminis@@ ation of the struggle for human rights@@ '. </s>
i therefore think that the proposal contained in the resolution on which we are to vote tomorrow is perfectly correct. </s>
finally, there will be differences between our parties on the common safe list, but the compromises we have sought to create, i think, are worthy of support in this house. </s>
first of all there is the middle east peace process where, for the first time in a long while, we now have, if not a break@@ through, then at least some clear progress. </s>
on this day in 2004, bomb attacks in madrid killed nearly 200 people. 16 months later, 52 people were killed during attacks in london. </s>
as regards the proposal of the ppe-de and pse groups that the governing council should decide by a double majority system, giving more weight to the members from the big member states, we beg to differ. </s>
this text could quite naturally be included in an annex to our rules of procedure, whilst it would not be necessary for the text on officials to be included. </s>
we must remember the horror that occurred when the insan@@ e ideas of two tyran@@ ts subjected the peoples of europe to mass murders, people slaughtered in death camps and the distortion of destin@@ y, black@@ ening the pages of europe’s history. </s>
they will probably now have to be re@@ integrated in the southern economy. </s>
the availability of spatial data is a necessary precondition for scientific evaluation conducted on the basis of environmental legislation. </s>
the next item is the oral question to the commission on the wto ministerial conference in hong kong by en@@ ri@@ que barón crespo on behalf of the committee on international trade o-0@@ 10@@ 8@@ /2005 b6-0@@ 34@@ 8@@ /2005. </s>
it is in this respect, as he also rightly points out, that the eu marks itself out as something more than just a free trade zone, and quite right too. </s>
however, i shall at least try to make my position clear on some aspects of this report which have concerned parliament in reaction to the commission' s initiative and the commitments announced by the council. </s>
we must clear up this mu@@ ddle and restore legislative consistency as soon as possible, and therefore we must adopt the commission's position on the directive as regards bio@@ gas. </s>
i would like to thank him in particular, as well as the committee as a whole for its outstanding work. </s>
i am well aware that this intelligent ambition is possible, since the eu budget continues to amount to about 1% of gross national income. </s>
more can be done and more needs to be done. </s>
i therefore very much welcome this resolution and parliament's strong support for sep@@ a. </s>
i think it is fair, balanced and comprehensive. </s>
prove that you are willing to accept political responsibility at this eleventh hour@@ ! </s>
there are numerous human rights abuses in burma@@ : forced labour, persecution of dissident@@ s, cons@@ cri@@ ption of child soldiers, etc. we call for aung san suu kyi and all those detained or put under house arrest to be immediately and unconditionally released, along with all other political prisoners, and for the n@@ ld offices closed in may 2003 to be re@@ opened. </s>
what is now crucial is to agree on policy conclusions and, if need be, corrective action on the basis of this assessment. </s>
however, i object to subsidising tobacco production in europe, and not only as a matter of general principle: the public funds allocated for this area could be used elsewhere and in a better way. </s>
enlarging the eurozone to include another country, slovakia, will definitely lead to deeper european integration. </s>
the rules in the procedures directive cover perhaps the most complex part of the whole asylum package. </s>
apparently that is not going to happen, and that is a sad thing for us all! </s>
we are prepared to help the eritre@@ an government to improve the human rights situation. </s>
to that extent i am pleased that i was able, in cooperation with other groups and members, to help ensure that the right of consumers to have their personal details treated confidenti@@ ally and their personal systems protected will be incorporated into this package. </s>
you, commissioner, said to us one day: ' tell your fellow citizens that joining in a partnership could well turn into a business@@ ' . </s>
mr president, while i thank the commissioner for his answer i would like him to give us a little more information - if i could te@@ ase some out of him. </s>
in order to achieve this, the priority must not be economic or customs relations, but relations between the ordinary people and organisations in turkey and those of other european countries. </s>
we now need a new agreement, as the belgian company swift is moving to europe, but we are both keen to retain the programme in order to prevent the financing of terrorism. </s>
there are issues of budgetary control which i would like you to expand on in your written reply. </s>
in a couple of hours we will vote on cultural programmes, the labelling of organic products, and requirements for harmonising taxation, all issues in which the union should not involve itself at all. </s>
in the longer term, in the light of experience and information as a result of implementing the framework water directive, we may then be in a much better position to translate threshold values at national level into eu-wide groundwater quality standards. </s>
resolution on women in decision making b5-0@@ 18@@ 0@@ /2000 </s>
mr president, i feared that, after having denied us the right to table amendments, you were also denying us the right to speak. </s>
this is why we have tabled proposals aimed at rein@@ stating at least basic levels of protection for all workers in the eu. </s>
certain political groups in this parliament are proposing a vote on a supposedly '@@ urgent@@ ' motion for a resolution. </s>
it would mean forgetting the thousands of others who will die from it even once it has been banned, in a few months or years. </s>
i would urge president van rompuy and president barroso to reconsider the nature of the so-called exit strategy. </s>
finally, in refusing christian heritage, the cultural short-sigh@@ tedness of this constitution is a worrying form of revision@@ ism. </s>
it was certainly a matter that needed regul@@ ating. </s>
local elected representatives seem to have been their preferred target, in the last few months. </s>
it will be able to make an active contribution to developing the new european citizenship by providing a common knowledge base of scientific and technological references and by facilitating dialogue between scientists and decision-mak@@ ers. </s>
pt one of the areas of education which is still lagging behind in certain european union countries, in particular portugal, is pre-school education. </s>
the people of france and the netherlands showed us that we have lost touch with our own elect@@ ors. </s>
furthermore, it will be unavoid@@ ably necessary, at one time or another, to get back to work on the problem of repres@@ sing criminality through the third pillar, or by means of conventions. </s>
we requested the postponement so that we could remain involved as a parliament in the communication process with the united states within the wto. </s>
so our idea of competition law must gain international acceptance. </s>
calling for a ban on cloned animals in food production may not address that issue if the research stage of that process is concerned. </s>
indeed, perhaps it is precisely because of the way that these funds are used that many european citizens are no longer so convinced that the european union is worthwhile. </s>
. i am grateful for the gr@@ acious words of mr kar@@ im@@ , the question@@ er, and i hope his faith in my performance will be v@@ indicated in the minutes to come. </s>
we need to be self-@@ confident enough as europeans to say who we like and who we think is appropriate and then to elect these people and not to decide on the basis of whether other people have or have not heard of them or whether or not they suit our partners throughout the world. </s>
these limits have to be respected, so a public register may not be the best solution. </s>
the joint debate is closed. </s>
to conclude i would like to state that the diversity that exists within the european union is positive, however, it is this same diversity that requires flexibility. </s>
in respect of the cap, agricultural prices are set in a unit of account which is based on the ecu. </s>
another requirement concerns such things as the social status of participating young people, social security, labour laws, tax exemption, and so on. </s>
however, it is not only the chinese market which is a problem, because highly developed economies such as the united states, japan and canada also pursue protectionist policies. </s>
such technologies have many applications, particularly owing to their overall efficiency as compared with conventional combus@@ tion. </s>
given the equal representation of the worl@@ ds of sport and government in the world anti-doping agency and given all those who will sit on the board of this agency - all the federations and all the national olympic committees - who have all undertaken to implement, in their own area, the decisions taken by the agency, there is real hope. </s>
it is definitely a particular task when it comes not to the application of sanctions and military intervention, but to cooperation and, if necessary, some degree of sanctions with regard to a group of countries. </s>
what we are doing now is creating a framework to permit willing member states to actually introduce a system of internalisation of external costs - following a national debate, in their own time and usually after years of preparation. </s>
de madam president, you are undoubtedly a competent vice-president and you are also highly influ@@ enti@@ al. </s>
i also support the proposal to set up a reflection group. </s>
once you have that information collection system on, you can then use it for anti-@@ sk@@ id systems. </s>
i am therefore surprised that there are still many in this discussion who still believe that the liberalisation of the world food trade is the perfect solution to resolve all evils in development cooperation and the fight against poverty. </s>
the right of petition, enshrined in the ec treaty in articles 21 and 19@@ 4, is a significant feature of european citizenship as it enables any european union citizen and any natural or legal person residing or having a registered office in a member state to address the european parliament on matters falling within the eu's remit. </s>
physical violence is one of several strategies of oppression. </s>
the german authorities have rightly halted proceedings which were already quite far advanced on learning that mrs jeggle had been elected to this parliament and in due course sent a request to parliament for mrs jegg@@ le's immunity to be wai@@ ved. </s>
i have a preference myself and i have said before to parliament that in addition to dealing with questions like the bse vaccines programme and aeron@@ au@@ tics, landmines is something that ought to be considered. </s>
the new possibilities are also good for the people who live in the alpine region and for the environment there, which has been seriously damaged by the so-called environmental transit traffic. </s>
my second comment is about subsidiarity. </s>
president trichet is better placed to testify on that than me because he was there then, but i would tend to agree, and that is why in our legislative package, which is now in your hands and in the hands of the council, we want to supplement the strong monetary union by finally creating a genuine and strong economic union. </s>
the council has fully adhered to the practice adopted up to now and has included romania and bulgaria, which will have acceded by then, in its calculations for the appropriations for the tenth edf in 2008. </s>
if you succeed, it will be a success for all of us, for the entire continent of europe! </s>
there is a chance - and here of course we are dying to know what will happen - that you will receive the newly elected german chancellor in pörtscha@@ ch. </s>
we must ensure that copenhagen marks a turning point in terms of practical joint commitment by stronger economies to create a fund that will guarantee a continual flow of funding for sustainable development in emerging countries. </s>
catalon@@ ia is a deeply euro@@ ph@@ ile nation, and yet today that nation has some difficulty in finding its place in this institution. </s>
the commission has rejected the plan to abandon this airport regulation with cry@@ p@@ tic statements which indicate that it will still be possible in future to turn away asylum seekers at the border, if they come from a safe country. </s>
